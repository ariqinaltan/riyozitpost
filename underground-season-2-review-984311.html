This is Underground creators <span data-scayt_word=Misha data-scaytid=2>Misha</span> Green and Joe <span data-scayt_word="Pokaski's" data-scaytid=3>Pokaski’s</span> take on the famous line from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend,” and it’s also the ethos of their show. Harriet Tubman may not have ever wielded two rifles at once, and Cannon certainly died 30 years before the events of the series, but if pitting the conductor of the Underground Railroad against the wicked operator of the so-called Reverse Underground Railroad spurs an audience to clamor to know more, then Green and <span data-scayt_word="Pokaski's" data-scaytid=4>Pokaski’s</span> blend of <span data-scayt_word=mythologizing data-scaytid=6>mythologizing</span> and <span data-scayt_word=historicizing data-scaytid=7>historicizing</span> has done its secondary job. The show’s first job continues to be entertaining viewers with an occasionally uncomfortable blend of escapist thrills and character-driven torment.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Picking up the second season, still some years ahead of the start of the Civil War, <span data-scayt_word=Rosalee data-scaytid=9>Rosalee</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Jurnee data-scaytid=10>Jurnee</span> <span data-scayt_word=Smollett-Bell data-scaytid=11>Smollett-Bell</span>) is working under Tubman’s tutelage to deliver escaped slaves to freedom, while also strategizing with abolitionists John (Marc <span data-scayt_word=Blucas data-scaytid=12>Blucas</span>) and Elizabeth (Jessica de <span data-scayt_word=Gouw data-scaytid=13>Gouw</span>) <span data-scayt_word=Hawkes data-scaytid=14>Hawkes</span> to figure out how to free Noah (<span data-scayt_word=Aldis data-scaytid=15>Aldis</span> Hodge) from a prison stint that could lead either back into bondage or hanging.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Rosalee's" data-scaytid=16>Rosalee’s</span> mother <span data-scayt_word=Ernestine data-scaytid=17>Ernestine</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Amirah data-scaytid=18>Amirah</span> <span data-scayt_word=Vann data-scaytid=19>Vann</span>, now a cast regular) has gone from the big house at the Macon plantation to a more tenuous position at a coastal South Carolina farm. The rest of the surviving members of the Macon 7, plus at least one memorable bounty hunter, are spread out in disparate locations and they get brought into the main narrative only gradually.</p><p>The second season premiere — directed by executive producer Anthony Hemingway and, like the rest of the season, written by Green and <span data-scayt_word=Pokaski data-scaytid=20>Pokaski</span>&nbsp;— emulates the show’s original hook with the strategizing and attempted execution of a prison break, both from inside with Noah, but also on the outside as Elizabeth makes some scheming new friends with the ladies of the Sewing Circle, fronted by <span data-scayt_word=Jasika data-scaytid=21>Jasika</span> Nicole’s Georgia. The high-adrenaline excitement of the escape attempt, set in vintage Underground anachronistic style to K Bishop’s “Shackles and Chains,” makes for a propulsive season opener, but its aftermath sets the show up for what looks to be a darker run of episodes.</p><p>A number of surprising casualties shaped Underground into a strikingly female-driven show by the first season finale, and that’s a trend that continues. Yes, the male stars remain and probably will play a major role in the second half of this season, along with new addition <span data-scayt_word=Bokeem data-scaytid=22>Bokeem</span> Woodbine, but I’d say that the early episodes belong to the women.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span data-scayt_word="Smollett-Bell's" data-scaytid=26>Smollett-Bell’s</span> <span data-scayt_word=Rosalee data-scaytid=24>Rosalee</span> made a believable first-season transition from pampered to resourceful, and that continues here as she balances the selfish desire to liberate her man with her newfound calling on the Underground Railroad. She only benefits from getting to share scenes with Hinds, whose Tubman is such a righteous badass she’d draw multiple spontaneous rounds of applause were Underground showing in a crowded movie theater.</p><p>Also continuing an organic path is de <span data-scayt_word="Gouw's" data-scaytid=28>Gouw’s</span> Elizabeth, becoming more and more involved in the resistance. As Elizabeth puts it in a line that’s also a contemporarily resonant battle cry, “The system isn’t going anywhere. We have to figure out a way to disrupt it.”</p><p>Both <span data-scayt_word=Smollett-Bell data-scaytid=29>Smollett-Bell</span> and de <span data-scayt_word=Gouw data-scaytid=30>Gouw</span> gave strong performances last season and are pushed to even more searing intensity in season two.</p><p>Making the biggest step into centrality is <span data-scayt_word="Vann's" data-scaytid=37>Vann’s</span> <span data-scayt_word=Ernestine data-scaytid=33>Ernestine</span>, whose life-and-death decisions last year have her haunted both figuratively and literally. I’m not sure if&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word="Vann's" data-scaytid=38>Vann’s</span> recurring status last year was about the actress’ other commitments or the writers not knowing for sure how much need they had for <span data-scayt_word=Ernestine data-scaytid=34>Ernestine</span>, but the character has gone from a vivid supporting role to one of the show’s key pivots. The third episode in particular is an intense and harrowing showcase for <span data-scayt_word=Vann data-scaytid=35>Vann</span> and <span data-scayt_word=Smollett-Bell data-scaytid=36>Smollett-Bell</span>, as well as an in-depth introduction for Stratton’s Patty Cannon.</p><p>The show is so thematically rich as an exploration of extreme steps women had to take to find power 50 years before they would receive the franchise that I mostly didn’t miss the male stars in their protracted absences. I did miss some of the dynamics that came from the interplay with some of those characters, and in a 10-episode season, I sometimes wondered if these early episodes were being a little too diffuse, straying too far from the Antebellum Dirty Dozen trappings of the first season. Those concerns came around only rarely and only briefly.</p><p>Underground remains most notable for its great versatility. With Hemingway directing half of this season’s episodes, it’s a show of explosive action beats, with a modern soundtrack and more attitude than just about anything on TV. It’s a series of fun and harrowing historical tidbits, from abolitionist-society passwords to distressing strategies to induce miscarriages. It’s a fiercely political show with intentional echoes in modern feminism and Black Lives Matter advocacy and an ensemble of multi-dimensional roles almost all for women and people of color. With this season’s Patty Cannon storyline, it’s an even more direct commentary on both the myth-making of the period and the myth-making of the show itself. And it’s a show in which Harriet Tubman taking on armed outlaws with a pair of rifles feels like the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Who wouldn’t want to watch that?</p><p>Cast: <span data-scayt_word=Jurnee data-scaytid=44>Jurnee</span> <span data-scayt_word=Smollett-Bell data-scaytid=45>Smollett-Bell</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Aldis data-scaytid=46>Aldis</span> Hodge, Jessica de <span data-scayt_word=Gouw data-scaytid=47>Gouw</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Alano data-scaytid=60>Alano</span> Miller, Christopher <span data-scayt_word=Meloni data-scaytid=61>Meloni</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Amirah data-scaytid=48>Amirah</span> <span data-scayt_word=Vann data-scaytid=49>Vann</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Bokeem data-scaytid=50>Bokeem</span> Woodbine, <span data-scayt_word=Jasika data-scaytid=51>Jasika</span> Nicole, Marc <span data-scayt_word=Blucas data-scaytid=52>Blucas</span><br><span data-scayt_word=Creators-showrunners data-scaytid=131>Creators-showrunners</span>: <span data-scayt_word=Misha data-scaytid=53>Misha</span> Green and Joe <span data-scayt_word=Pokaski data-scaytid=54>Pokaski</span><br>Premieres: Wednesday, 10 p.m. ET/PT (<span data-scayt_word=WGN data-scaytid=70>WGN</span> America)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaeyt7XEsKporZ6ZsrOz0aisp5xdqLKiv86nZGtloprDqrHWZnBxbGNmfnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1515976-100-inspirational-makeup-quotes-by-historical-beauty-icons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>100 inspirational makeup quotes by the historical beauty icons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-harry-meghan-markle-docuseries-episode-1-recap-first-date.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Harry &amp;amp; Meghan' Episode 1 Gives First Look at Couple's First Date, Early Romance</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
