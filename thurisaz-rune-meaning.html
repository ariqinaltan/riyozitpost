That is the mentality of a loser because they cannot see the goodness within them. They should simply see the bigger picture within any form of change because <a href=#>changes do happen for a positive reason</a>. Therefore, you should not only see the negative side behind any change but do see the positive result it carries. That is why you will find less successful people in the worldly realm because they cannot see what is right for them. More so, you should avoid putting yourself in comfortable zones because that is the greatest thing that has killed innocent souls. Notably, you should be willing to play hard in your life for the greatness of tomorrow.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><p>On the other hand, Thurisaz symbolism shows the <a href=#>benefits of early planning</a>. Early planning will give you the advantage of understanding your next move before it happens. In other words, you will not meet surprises in your life. Sometimes, some surprises can be very overwhelming in that you can easily lose your focus because you will be concentrating on one thing. Thus, avoid being a victim of circumstance by initiating every change you meet along the way. Equally, do not be tempted to retreat to a negative world by ignoring to change your life.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2><strong>Rune Poem for Thurisaz</strong></h2><p>“ Ðorn byþ ðearle scearp;<br>ðegna gehwylcum anfeng ys yfyl,<br>ungemetum reþe manna gehwelcum,<br>ðe him mid resteð.”</p><p>“Thorn is very sharp · for every thane<br>Who grabs it?

With the thorn rune present, <a href=#>your enemy cannot stand</a>, be it ignorance or frost giant.</p><p>advertisement</p><p>advertisement</p><h2>Thurisaz Power</h2><p>Thor governs this rune, with Mjolnir in hand. <a href=#>Wisdom and Awareness</a> are the lessons of this rune, the shining light that will see you through the darkness of ignorance.</p><p>Before the thorn, all things crumble. It will pierce the veil of ignorance, crumble the hard soil to prepare for the seed, and <a href=#>clear away fear and ignorance</a> so that enthusiasm may grow in its place.</p><p>The Thurs represents tools, both the handle of the simple spade and the haft of the mighty axe that is used to strike down one’s enemy.</p><h2>Thurisaz Rune Magic</h2><p>Thorn will fire you through creation, giving you the clear light and <a href=#>energy to pursue the goals</a> you would see complete. When you are pursuing your goals, Thorn will sit like a burr in your saddle, pushing you forward with the need to complete it.</p><p>So also is the energy of Thurs; it is <a href=#>a gateway rune</a>. Power like water behind a dam, directed through a turbine it will generate electricity that can be put to useful work, but break the damn, and it will lay waste to all that lay before it.</p><h2><strong>Thurisaz – Merkstave Meaning (Reversed)</strong></h2><h3><strong>Keywords:</strong></h3><p>Psychological Problems, <a href=#>Complexities Of Aggression</a>, Confusion, Destruction By Natural Forces, Conflicts, Disputes, Trouble, Loki, Lightning</p><h4><strong>Interpretation:</strong></h4><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sunsigns.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thurisaz-merkstave.jpg alt="thurisaz merkstave" width=300 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>The Merkstave Thorn rune, <a href=#>burning arrow of the clouds</a>.

There is no resolution, and all words are swords; none are salves.</p><h2>Thurisaz Protection</h2><p>When the Thurisaz rune comes in the dark, the seer must divine the way; the lightning crashes through the heavens and sets the forests afire. The mountains roar as their white locks rumble down over the cliffs and valleys to crush the longhouse beneath its tresses. Beware the Merkstave Thorn, and it is energy undirected, chaos unleashed.</p><p>When the Merkstave Thurs rune appears, one must <a href=#>take care with acts of aggression</a>, and their underlying complexities will turn around like a snake upon itself.</p><p>In your mind, it will twist in the shadows, bringing up those thorns that will dig into you, breaking down the strength within; with the Merkstave rune in place, one must guard against these.
