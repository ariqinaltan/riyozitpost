actor Jodi Gordon and her ex-boyfriend have agreed to stop speaking to each other for two years after their relationship broke down and a “physical altercation” was alleged to have taken place.</p><p>Police applied for apprehended violence orders (AVOs) to be put in place to protect Ms Gordon, 37, and Sebastian Blackler after an incident on April 3 at a bed and breakfast in Kurrajong Heights, 75 km north west of Sydney.</p><p>Blackler, 31, and the former Home and Away and Neighbours star did not appear when their cases were mentioned in Windsor Local Court on Thursday.</p><p>Instead, their lawyers appeared via videolink to tell Magistrate Leanne Robinson the former couple had agreed to abide by AVOs preventing them from contacting each other in any way for two years.</p><p>Gordon and Blackler must also not assault, intimidate, threaten, stalk or harass each other, or damage each other’s property, under the final AVOs Magistrate Robinson enforced.</p><p>While Gordon and Blackler agreed to abide by the AVO conditions, the court was told the pair would make no admissions regarding any allegations contained in court documents lodged by police.</p><p>Gordon or Blackler have not been accused of any wrongdoing and police have laid no charges.</p><p>According to <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=4994f1e5fcf90473749d08909e363667 data-tgev-label=nation data-tgev-metric=ev>court documents obtained by The Australian</a>, the AVOs were taken out after Gordon reported a “physical altercation” while at the bed and breakfast.</p><p>In the documents, police allege the Logie-winning former Neighbours and Home and Away star was found with bruises on her eye and lip, along with lumps on her forehead.</p><p>Police alleged Gordon was drunk and claimed she “fell against the counter”.</p><p>The injuries “appear to be days old”, the court documents state.</p><p>After the incident, Mr Blackler was also allegedly found with swelling and bruising on his left eye.</p><p>“Blackler stated Gordon hit him with a wine bottle,” police said in court documents.</p><p>“Blackler was asked to provide a statement (but) declined.</p><p>“Police fear domestic assaults are occurring between the parties with Gordon’s consumption of intoxicating liquor exacerbating the violence...there is clearly domestic violence occurring between the parties (but they) are reluctant to disclose how the injuries have been sustained.”</p><p>The incident comes as Gordon prepares to make a TV comeback in Nine’s new series of The Celebrity Apprentice.</p><p>It was not the first time police were called to intervene in Gordon and Blackler’s failed relationship.</p><p>In November 2020, police attended Gordon’s Double Bay apartment to investigate an allegation of domestic violence.</p><p>An interim AVO was taken out which prohibited Mr Blackler from assaulting or threatening, stalking, harassing or intimidating Gordon.</p><p>It expired at the end of 2021 and no charges were laid.</p><p>The pair reportedly broke up in May last year, but it is understood they reconnected towards the end of February this year.</p><p>After her first split with Blackler in 2021, Gordon dated Sydney businessman Aidan Walsh.</p><p>That relationship ended in December 2021, just months after she announced they were an item on social media debut.</p><p>Gordon was previously married to former NRL star and Fox Sports presenter Braith Anasta between 2005 and 2010.</p><p>In 2009, while dating Channel 7 CEO Ryan Stokes, she was found cowered in the bedroom of bikie Mark Judge after Stokes lodged a missing persons report.</p><p>The pair reportedly told police they were being hunted by outlaw bikies.</p><p>Police failed to find any attackers and Stokes and Gordon broke up after the incident.</p><p class=postsid
