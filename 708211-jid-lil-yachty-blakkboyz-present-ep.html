Firstly, the former is an incredible MC when it comes to rapping fast while also telling a story. Secondly, Yachty is mostly known for his ability to give you autotuned melodies and a mix of genres. However, he has proven himself to be quite the spitter when he wants to be. That said, it still felt pretty unlikely that these two would come through with a collaborative song or even a project.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, they stunned fans this week <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">when they revealed that they would drop two new tracks together</a>. They are doing so under the duo name Blakkboyz, and fans are curious if this could lead to a new album. That said, they are testing the waters with these two songs. The first of these songs is called "Half Doin Dope" which features BabyTron. Moreover, they also came through with Van Gogh, which doesn't have any other artists listed.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jid-x-lil-yachty>JID x Lil Yachty</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, both of these tracks are packed with energy. JID brings his usual speedy flow to the table, and interestingly enough, Yachty matches him. It makes for two dynamic songs that are bolstered by a BabyTron feature that has all of the personality you would expect. If you like these artists, you are going to have to give this a listen, immediately.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know which of these two tracks from Lil Yachty and JID are your favorite, in the comments section below.
