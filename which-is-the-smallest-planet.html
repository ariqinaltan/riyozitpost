Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.</p><h2>Which is planet is the smallest?</h2>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It's a little bigger than Earth's Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it's actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.<h2>Which is the 2 smallest planet?</h2>Closest to the sun, Mercury is the second smallest planet in our solar system. It has an orbital period of 87.97 Earth days and rotates on its axis once every 59 Earth days. The average surface temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.<h2>What are the 3 smallest planets?</h2>Though Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the smallest of the known planets, each is clearly impressive in different ways. You Can Learn More About Your Solar System and the Four Largest Planets Here!<h2>Who is the biggest planet?</h2>The Latest. Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.<h2>What is the smallest planet in our solar system?</h2><p></p><h2>What is the most Big planet?</h2>Largest Planet: Jupiter<p>The largest planet in our solar system by far is Jupiter, which beats out all the other planets in both mass and volume. Jupiter's mass is more than 300 times that of Earth, and its diameter, at 140,000 km, is about 11 times Earth's diameter.</p><h2>What color is Mars?</h2>Mars, known as the Red Planet, is a mostly dry and dusty place. A variety of colors can be seen on the surface, including the predominant rusty red the planet is known for. This rusty red color is iron oxide, just like the rust that forms here on Earth when iron oxidizes – often in the presence of water.<h2>What is the second largest planet?</h2>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.<h2>What color is Venus?</h2>Viewed through a telescope, Venus presents a brilliant yellow-white, essentially featureless face to the observer. Its obscured appearance results from the surface of the planet being hidden from sight by a continuous and permanent cover of clouds. Features in the clouds are difficult to see in visible light.<h2>Which is called Red planet?</h2>Mars is known as the Red Planet. It is red because the soil looks like rusty iron. Mars has two small moons. Their names are Phobos (FOE-bohs) and Deimos (DEE-mohs).<h2>Is the smallest planet Pluto?</h2>A while back, Pluto was the ninth planet from the Sun. It was also the smallest planet.<h2>Is Sun a planet?</h2>The sun and moon are not planets when you consider the objects in space they orbit. For the sun to be a planet, it would have to orbit another sun. Although the sun is in a orbit, it moves around the center of mass of the Milky Way galaxy, not another star.<h2>Is Uranus the smallest planet?</h2>Answer and Explanation: Uranus is not the smallest planet, but is one of the largest. The smallest planet in the solar system is Mercury, which is also the closest to the...<h2>Is Neptune the smallest planet?</h2>Neptune is the fourth largest planet in terms of diameter, making it the smallest in physical size of the gas giants. The average distance from the center of the planet to its surface is 15,299 miles (24,622 kilometers). But like most spinning bodies, Neptune's rotation causes it to bulge slightly around the equator.<h2>Who is the twin of Earth?</h2>Venus: Earth's twin planet?<h2>Which is beautiful planet?</h2>The planet Saturn is probably the best known and most beautiful planet in the Solar System. Saturn's rings are far more extensive and more easily seen than those of any other planet.<h2>Which is the Pink planet?</h2>Named GJ 504b, the planet is made of pink gas. It's similar to Jupiter, a giant gas planet in our own solar system. But GJ 504b is four times more massive. At 460°F, it's the temperature of a hot oven, and it's the planet's intense heat that causes it to glow.<h2>What Colour is Saturn?</h2>Viewed from Earth, Saturn has an overall hazy yellow-brown appearance. The surface that is seen through telescopes and in spacecraft images is actually a complex of cloud layers decorated by many small-scale features, such as red, brown, and white spots, bands, eddies, and vortices, that vary over a fairly short time.<h2>Is Mars Hot or cold?</h2>Temperatures on Mars average about -81 degrees F. However, temperatures range from around -220 degrees F. in the wintertime at the poles, to +70 degrees F.<h2>Can we live on Mars?</h2>Human survival on Mars would require living in artificial Mars habitats with complex life-support systems. One key aspect of this would be water processing systems. Being made mainly of water, a human being would die in a matter of days without it.<h2>How old is Mars?</h2>Mars was formed at the same time as the rest of the Solar System, from a large spinning disk of gas and dust. Astronomers think that all this happened about 4.6 billion years ago! So Mars is about 4.6 billion years old.<h2>What planet is the hottest?</h2>It has a strong greenhouse effect, similar to the one we experience on Earth. Because of this, Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system. The surface of Venus is approximately 465°C!<h2>What planet is the coldest?</h2>The coldest planet in our solar system on record goes to Uranus which is closer to the Sun and 'only' about 20 times further away from the Sun than the Earth is. The lowest temperature recorded there was minus 224 degrees Celsius.<h2>Is Jupiter Blue?</h2>It is not actually blue; the name is an artifact of the color scheme used in mapping Jupiter's magnetic field. Indeed, photographs yield no visible hints of the Great Blue Spot.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahoJygXZ7AbsDHnmSspZGhuaa%2F02anpZmemsE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-medha-jalota-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Medha Jalota?
