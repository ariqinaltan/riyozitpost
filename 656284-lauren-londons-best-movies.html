Her breakout role was as "New New" in ATL alongside <a href=# class=text-word rel>T.I.</a>, but the actress's resumé goes far beyond the fan favorite film. She's recently starred alongside Jonah Hill, Nia Long, and Eddie Murphy in You People, which set Netflix ablaze. We'll walk you through a few of London's noteworthy roles as we revisit her career highlights, in no particular order.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lauren-london-movies-early-life>Lauren London Movies: Early Life</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 27: Lauren London attends the BET Awards 2021 at Microsoft Theater on June 27, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for BET)</p><p>Lauren London was born in Los Angeles on December 5, 1984. She started out as a model, then appeared in music videos of popular stars before moving on to movies and TV shows. Her roles in the movies like ATL and Entourage have earned her recognition. Since then, she has continued to press forward with her career. Albeit, London took a break following the death of her partner <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nipsey Hussle</a>, but it seems she's back in the groove.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-alt-2006>7. ALT (2006)</h2></span><p><a href=# rel>ATL is an American comedy-drama movie</a> from 2006 about teens maturing in Atlanta. In this movie, Lauren London starred as Erin "New New" Garnett, who is Rashad's love interest and the daughter of John Garnett. This movie features four teenagers from a working-class family living in an Atlanta neighbourhood getting ready for life after high school. It's a film about growing up, getting a job, falling in love, and learning the importance of friends. Also, this movie is well-received by critics and you should check it out if you haven’t seen it!</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-i-love-you-beth-cooper-2009>6. I Love You, Beth Cooper (2009)</h2></span><p>In 2009, London Lauren starred in this teen comedy movie where she played the role of Cammy. I Love You, Beth Cooper is heavily reliant on shallow teen comedic clichés. In this movie, Denis (Paul Rust), a nerdy adolescent, has a secret crush on Beth Cooper (Hayden Panettiere), the hottest girl in high school. Definitely, this is one of the few movies where you want the hero to wake up and find out that everything was a dream.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-you-people-2023>5. You People (2023)&nbsp;</h2></span><p>You People is Lauren London's most recent movie. This film is a romantic comedy and in this movie, Lauren London played Ezra's (Jonah Hill) first love. However, their drama started when their parent find out they are of different beliefs. This led to them having to deal with the push and pull of their families. The star-studded cast rounded out the comedy, but the film was still heavily debated on social media.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-without-remorse-2021>4. Without Remorse(2021)&nbsp;</h2></span><p>Without Remorse, which is also known as <a href=# rel>Tom Clancy's Without Remorse</a>, is an action thriller movie. It is based on Clancy's 1993 novel of the same name. In this movie, Lauren London played the role of Pam Kelly, who was killed while pregnant and married to John Kelly. Without Remorse depicts a story of an elite Navy SEAL who finds out about an international plot while trying to find out who killed his pregnant wife. Intriguingly, a lot keeps unfolding in this action movie as John Kelly keeps searching for who killed Pam (Lauren London). Moreover, the suspenseful part is figuring out why she was killed and what this has to do with the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-poinsettias-for-christmas-2018>3. Poinsettias for Christmas (2018)</h2></span><p>Poinsettias for Christmas is a fun Christmas movie that doesn't get too mushy. In this movie, London stars as Patty. She was Ellie's (Bethany Joy Lenz) best friend when they were kids. Just a few weeks before Christmas, Ellie goes back home to help her father on the family's poinsettia farm. The family firm is putting its reputation on the line by delivering tens of thousands of plants for the town's annual parade. However, the trouble is that the poinsettias haven't turned red yet! However, Patty has to buy the farmland. Later, in the movie, she has to sell it back to Ellie. &nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-baggage-claim-2013>2. Baggage Claim (2013)</h2></span><p>In 2013, Lauren starred in this romantic comedy movie as Sheree. Baggage Claim is one of those predictable romantic comedies where a girl falls in love with a guy she meets in an unexpected way. This movie is about Montana Moore (Paula Patton) who is looking forward to getting married. However, Graham (Boris Kodjoe), the only guy she was interested in, dumped her for Sheree and got engaged. Nonetheless, this movie is filled with all the drama you can expect from a comedy.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-the-perfect-match-2016>1.
