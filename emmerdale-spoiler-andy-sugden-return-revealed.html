And while viewers would love to see Sarah reunited with her dad, it seems that the storyline won't be going that way, as actor Kelvin Fletcher has revealed that he has no plans to return to the soap just yet. Speaking to about the possibility, he said: "I honestly don't know. Andy wasn't killed off, so technically I could return. But I genuinely haven't given it much thought." The actor continued: "The two years since I left have flown by and, in many respects, my leaving still feels very fresh. I must get asked a couple of times a day when I'm going back." However, luckily for fans, Kelvin hasn’t completely dismissed the idea. " is in my blood," he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/858004091d5f-emmerdale-sarah-sugden-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGW2ag9a2oCH data-wc=20><strong>Sarah Sugden's dad Andy has gone on the run - and fans want him back to see his ill daughter</strong></p><p id=eAcwzGOV1KpT data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Emmerdale's Mark Jordon arrested over attacking pensioner</a></p><p id=esq3kg55-t_i data-wc=130>Andy left the Dales in dramatic scenes, following his 20-year stint on the show. The farmer’s son had been framed by his girlfriend Chrissie White for the attempted murder of her father, Lawrence White, and had gone on the run. It is touch and go for Andy’s daughter Sarah at the moment. The youngster has already battled cancer, but tragically the treatment resulted in her heart becoming weak. In next week's episodes, Sarah admits her nerves at the impending operation to Samson, revealing that she is worried that she will die. Her younger brother Jack, meanwhile, panics when he overhears mum Debbie talking about him saving Sarah's life when he was born - believing that he is going to have to be the one who donates his heart to her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c2f268158ed-charleywebbtwitter-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ex7YYclTH-UN data-wc=11><strong>Things are much happier in real life for the Emmerdale cast</strong></p><p id=eid5ewFITnA9 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Emmerdale's Laura Norton reveals the secret to her weight loss</a></p><p id=eKObCIYV4JkD data-wc=66>Luckily, life is far less stressful in real life for Andy and Debbie's onscreen daughter.
