Season 11 episode 17 sees the show’s mechanic forced to leave the mining show for emergency surgery.</strong></p><p>The people who star in Gold Rush are no strangers to the odd injury. Season 11 sees Johnny slip on a rock, while broken arms and other injuries have also occurred in past seasons.</p><p>But, when it comes to Carl Rosk, the severity of his illness looks to have taken him off the show. So, let’s take a look at Carl and what happened to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-20-at-11.29.37-1024x572.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-carl-rosk>Who is Carl Rosk?</h3><p>Carl Rosk is a cast member on The Discovery Channel’s Gold Rush.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Discovery</a>, Carl was born into the gold mining trade and owns 1,000 acres of land which he mined with his late grandfather.</p><p>Eating pizza, dirt biking, fishing and hunting are all past times of Carl’s – when he’s not mining for gold, of course.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=what-happened-to-carl-on-gold-rush>What happened to Carl on Gold Rush?</h3><p>Carl has appeared on Gold Rush since 2015. Six years later, he’s a familiar face on the Discovery show.</p><p>Fans of the show were understandably concerned when it was revealed that Carl would be taking a break from the show in episode 17, ‘Growing Pains’, to receive emergency surgery.</p><p>By the looks of things, Carl’s ill health isn’t new to some Gold Rusg viewers. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>A Reddit thread</a> from 2019 discusses how Rick spoke of Carl’s health problems during season 9 episode 12.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=does-carl-from-gold-rush-have-cancer>Does Carl from Gold Rush have cancer?</h3><p>It doesn’t seem that Carl has spoken publicly about his health, surgery or cancer.</p><p>However, there has been an ongoing theme in the show that he has disappeared for multiple surgeries.</p><p>Reddit users took to the internet in 2021 to discuss whether Carl is in ill health or not in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>thread</a>.</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Reddit user</a> <a href=#>The-Scotsman</a> said: “The tumour was mentioned a year or two ago in a previous season. THis is just surgery to get it removed. It’s a positive thing. They said it didn’t go as quickly as normal, but I’d expect he’ll be fine in he end.“</p><p><a href=#>PM-Me-Electrical</a> said: “He talked about having a tumor on his lung and another on his spine, Season 9, Episode 11, so it’s been with him a while.”</p><p>Season 9 episode 11 saw Carl not only state that he has a tumour, but he also had a breakdown during the show. It’s likely that Carl has exited season 11 for surgery for a tumour, however, he hasn’t confirmed any details about his health.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-20-at-11.29.56-1024x635.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnlJ7ApLvVnqmyZaedrrV5x5qnqZ2emrFuwM5mmpqqnGK8r3nGqKOdZaKqwKl5yKxkraCVYrqmr8eapaKbXZ65rQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pippa-middleton-stylish-wimbledon-fashion-outfits.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 times Pippa Middleton stole the show at Wimbledon with her must-see outfits</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heavenly-father-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bon Iver Heavenly Father lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
