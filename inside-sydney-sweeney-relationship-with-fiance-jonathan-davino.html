Keep reading for all the details on their romance…</p><h2 dir=ltr>The couple are extremely private</h2><p id=ePCSdGok-w- data-wc=55>The story of how Sydney and Jonathan met remains a mystery, but what we do know is that they were first spotted together at an Emmys party at the Nomad Hotel in Los Angeles in September 2018. A month later, the pair were all smiles at the InStyle and Kate Spade dinner at Spring Place.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/c8d76ac7f2a3-sydney-sweeney-jonathan-travino-cannes-2023.jpg><p id=ep4bhMutpP_ data-wc=60>Over the years, Jonathan has been a constant source of support for his girlfriend, accompanying Sydney to Pop Sugar's Play/Ground event in 2019, and more recently the 2023 Cannes Film Festival. After going public with their relationship, it was reported that Jonathan was a thriving restauranteur, but in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Glamour UK</a> in December, the star disparaged this.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8xue5Ub4zF data-wc=41>"I have no idea where that came from. He's also not the heir of a pizza company," said Sydney. "He's a business guy. He's from Chicago.

"Everyone is always so curious about who I'm with and what's that like, but I think it's important to have something for me," she explained. "I'm very open. I talk about so much and sometimes it gets me in trouble, but I do try to keep something for me."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Most romantic celebrity kisses of all time: Justin & Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce, more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/16c63ce40d99-justin-and-hailey-kissing.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Most romantic celebrity kisses of all time: Justin & Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce, more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Most romantic celebrity kisses of all time: Justin & Hailey Bieber, Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce, more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2 dir=ltr>Sydney and Jonathan are in no rush to get married</h2><p id=edfaFLX2ho6 data-wc=53>In December, Sydney joined her co-stars on the red carpet, where she was quizzed about her impending nuptials.

"Jonathan is my producing partner, so he helped put the whole thing together. It's really great to work with someone who knows you so well, who fully supports your ideas, your vision and your voice…" she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Glamour</a>. "And it's nice.
