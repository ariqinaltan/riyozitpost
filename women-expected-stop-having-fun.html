My partner spends a good portion of his free time gaming - and nobody tells him to grow up. And when men (read: Ben Affleck and Matt Damon) are seen laughing and joking together at award shows, people praise their camaraderie and male friendship, so why is there this societal pressure for women to be mature in our thirties?</p><p id=eN9XvsoG1PI data-wc=55>"There’s a societal double standard," Abby says. "Men are often encouraged to keep the fun alive as they age, but for women there’s this weird expectation to become more subdued. And when women challenge the status quo and continue having a blast, it disrupts these ingrained ideas about what they should or shouldn’t be doing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/72de9c94334f-gettyimages-1908171125.jpg><p id=epoYlOlCNkm data-wc=37><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Life coach Mhairi Todd</a> elaborates: "Our society is built around gender inequality. Women and girls are reminded constantly by (frankly outdated) societal norms that they are under a different sort of time pressure from their male counterparts.</p><p id=eZUQqbHHSKT data-wc=70>"As such there exists a belief that by 30, women should have ticked off various milestones: career, kids, marriage, house. The same pressure simply does not exist for men. Have you ever met a man in his late 30s and thought, 'Odd that he doesn't have kids'? Probably not. But maybe the thought has crossed your mind of a female acquaintance.

"Laughing reduces the stress hormone cortisol and releases ‘happy chemicals’ such as dopamine, oxytocin and endorphins into our systems.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dfb39bbaab9a-gettyimages-1775430516.jpg><p id=e6TQ-mC9ZOEr data-wc=66>"Oxytocin is also known as the bonding chemical and helps us feel connected to others in a powerful way.
