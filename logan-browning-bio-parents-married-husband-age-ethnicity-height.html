and TV sitcoms such as&nbsp;</span><span>Bratz: The Movie, Brotherly Love, Meet the Browns, For the Better For the Worse,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Hit the Floor</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;She is most popular for the hit Netflix series,&nbsp;</span><span>Dear White People</span><span>&nbsp;, where she plays the lead role of Samantha White.&nbsp;Find out more about Browning here…</span></p><h2><strong><span>Age, early life and rise to fame</span></strong></h2><p><span>Records state that this actress was named LoganLaurice Browning after her birth on June 9, 1989 in Atlanta, Georgia.&nbsp;She spent her formative years in Georgia and attended Fayette Country High School.&nbsp;For her college education, Browning moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where she attended Vanderbilt University.</span></p><p><span>Logan Browning was an actress from a young age and attended Barbizon Modeling and Acting School by the age of 14.&nbsp;</span><span>Summerland,</span><span>&nbsp;where she played a character named Callie.&nbsp;From there she got into the Nickelodeon series,&nbsp;</span><span>Ned’s declassified school survival guide</span><span>&nbsp;and also appeared in a music video.&nbsp;Browning got her big break in 2007 when she scored a spot in&nbsp;</span><span>Bratz: The Movie</span><span>&nbsp;, a musical comedy.&nbsp;Although the film wasn’t a commercial success, she used it to land other roles.</span></p><p><span>Since then, the Atlanta native has appeared in other projects, most notably Tyler Perry’s&nbsp;</span><span>Meet the Browns, Hit the Floor</span><span>&nbsp;(a VH1 series),&nbsp;</span><span>Kings Of Kings</span><span>&nbsp;(a Disney series),&nbsp;</span><span>The Secret Circle</span><span>&nbsp;(a CW supernatural drama) and&nbsp;</span><span>The Survivor’s Remorse</span><span>.&nbsp;Browning’s most important project to date is undoubtedly the popular Netflix series Dear White People.&nbsp;In it she plays Samantha White, a college activist and radio host.&nbsp;The series began in 2017 and focuses on the issue of race relations in America.&nbsp;It received positive reviews from critics and fans, and Browning was acclaimed for her convincing portrayal of her character.&nbsp;In turn, she revealed that she had to do some heavy reading to prepare for the role.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Logan Browning Parents and Ethnicity</span></strong></h2><p><span>Logan Browning comes from a family of six.&nbsp;Among them are Larry, her father, his wife Lynda Browning, and three brothers – Keith, Clinton and Chad.&nbsp;Browning’s parents are both African American.</span></p><span>In May 2018, the actress revealed on TheBreakfast Club that she was in fact adopted and that her biological mother is white while her biological father is black.&nbsp;She had never met her and found out about her adoption at a young age.&nbsp;Due to the fact that her biological mother is white while her biological father is black, she is biracial – a mix of Caucasian and African American.</span><p><span>However, the actress identifies as black.&nbsp;In her words, she grew up in a black household and not a biracial one.&nbsp;She has emphasized that all of her experiences were those of a black person.&nbsp;When Browning was cast as the lead in&nbsp;</span><span>Dear White People</span><span>&nbsp;, she faced a backlash from some people who felt that the role should have gone to a person of darker complexion.&nbsp;She herself believes that her own life experiences make her the perfect match for Samantha, who has to navigate both sides of racial segregation.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she married, who is her husband?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Logan Browning isn’t married yet, as is her no husband that we know of.&nbsp;The actress dated rapper Tyga in 2009.&nbsp;Their relationship reportedly lasted two years and they broke up in 2012.&nbsp;Since then, she has been quiet about the relationship.&nbsp;This is unlike Tyga, who acquired a number of popular exes, including Blac Chyna and Kylie Jenner.&nbsp;Browning has shown that her ideal man is someone who is smart, ambitious, fun and motivated.&nbsp;She also loves deep thinkers and people to learn from.&nbsp;Also, she doesn’t care about the race of the person.</span></p><h2><strong><span>size and body characteristics</span></strong></h2><p><span>Logan Browning has a slim figure.&nbsp;She is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs a moderate 115 lb (52 kg).&nbsp;Her hair color is dark brown and she has mesmerizing green eyes.</span></p><p><span>Besides acting, Browning admires other creative career paths such as interior design, house flipping, and advertising.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
