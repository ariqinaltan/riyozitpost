At the time of writing, the GoFundMe set up to help Brown stands at over $700,000. However, it's unclear if that is with or without Perry's nearly half-million offer. This remains a developing story and we'll keep you up updated as more details emerge. However, the philanthropic gesture did not absolve Perry in the eyes of many fans. "He be doing things for public and dogging people in private. People with money who are shady always try to look good in public give Monique her apology and stop fronting," one person noted. "Hopefully people have insurance for their belongings because everyone doesn’t get this type of support," mused another.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Perry has long been a divisive figure in entertainment. Furthermore, that reputation has only grown in recent months. Whether it's the fallout from Ruthless, his feud with Mo'Nique, or his directorial role for a film about an all-women World War II brigade, there is plenty that fans have taken issue with.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tyler-perry-accused-of-not-paying-viral-meme-star-antoine-dodson-for-madea-cameo>Tyler Perry Accused Of Not Paying Viral Meme Star Antoine Dodson For Madea Cameo</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, if recent allegations are to be believed, Perry might not always be this generous. Antoine Dodson, better known as the star of the viral "Bed Intruder" meme, has accused Tyler Perry of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">not paying</a> him to cameo in A Madea Christmas. Dodson said that Perry had reached out and a verbal agreement had been made. However, Perry allegedly never followed through with compensating Dodson for his work. Perry is yet to respond to the allegations.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A Madea Christmas came out in 2013, around three years after Dodson found viral fame. Dodson is credited as "YouTube Guy" in the film. However, fans have not been wholly sympathetic. Some people have teased Dodson for coming after Perry now he's "broke". Others have accused Dodson of claiming that there was promises of compensation when none was agreed upon.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
