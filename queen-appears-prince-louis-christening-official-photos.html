And whilst physically that was the case – <a class=hm-link href=#>the Duke</a> and <a class=hm-link href=#>Duchess of Cambridge</a> still thought of a very clever way to make her part of the historic moment.</p><p id=e1xmIW-h_ndN data-wc=73>The family-of-five, which took the official pictures in the Morning Room at Clarence House, made sure that they were positioned correctly so a portrait of the Queen in her younger years could feature in the background - just behind Prince Harry. Prince George's christening portraits were also taken in the same room, but as the Queen was present then, the angle of the photos was different and her portrait didn't make an appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e80608ef3153-queen-features-christening-photos-z.jpg><p id=eOVL3mBurlof data-wc=60>Coincidently, the Queen is wearing blue, the colour that was chosen by Princess Charlotte, Prince George, Carole and Pippa Middleton, Princes Charles, William and Harry and James Matthews and James Middleton. The Duchesses of Cambridge and Cornwall and Prince Louis chose to wear neutral tones in white and cream whilst the Duchess of Sussex chose a surprising olive green outfit.</p><p id=eEEcFb5btj2w data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why Prince William and Kate Middleton changed the rules and shared this new photo of Prince Louis</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c16a3e1438b7-royal-family-queen-prince-louis-christening-z.jpg><p id=e-LOXutBU7z0 data-wc=100>There is a very sweet meaning behind Meghan not following the dress code though, as green is thought to be one of the most calming colours there are, while her exact shade – olive green – represents the traditional colour of peace. Green is also known to connote love and nurture, as well as a love of family and nature. As somebody who has recently joined the royal family, it could have been that Meghan was wishing to represent these qualities to bring positivity to <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Louis' special day</a> – which took place in the same chapel were she was baptised earlier this year.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eAXP-rBIHFEC data-wc=1><strong>REVEALED: <a class=hm-link href=#>The thing you might not have noticed about Princess Charlotte in this christening photo</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
