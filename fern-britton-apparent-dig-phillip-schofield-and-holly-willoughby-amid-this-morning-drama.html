At the time, it was claimed she felt "undervalued by ITV" and that she was "living in Phil's shadow". Four years after her exit, Phillip revealed that they were no longer on speaking terms, telling magazine: "We were involved in the show and mates at the time, but we don't really. I see Phil [Fern's then-husband, chef Phil Vickery] when he's in This Morning… But we're not in touch now."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/30bee11b7e83-holly-phillip-on-this-morning.jpg><p id=eJ9SmXcqFg data-wc=30><a class=hm-link href=#>Fern was clearly in agreement</a> as she later told : "I always say Phillip and I had an indefinable chemistry which seemed to work well on-screen.

I think, for whatever reason, that was the point Fern decided she didn't want to do This Morning any more." He added that he tried to "make it right" after the fallout and that he "misses her deeply".&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/047e918869f8-shutterstockeditorial9764705ag-2.jpg><p id=ejvB5AjXHRO data-wc=69>Their tense relationship was also revealed on social media after Fern tweeted about This Morning’s BAFTA for 30 years: "Congrats on the BAFTA. That was absolutely wonderful and brilliant. I would have loved to have been there but I didn't get an invitation." Phillip replied: "Odd really, because she was invited and declined #memoryloss we'd have loved her to be there. A vital and much-loved part of the show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5c5e5f3deccf-fern-britton-arthritis-d.jpg><p id=eFRFRTpm5h data-wc=59>Meanwhile, <a class=hm-link href=#>Eamonn has also been open</a> about his feelings towards Phillip in the past after his partner Ruth Langsford made a complaint about his behaviour to ITV. He told the magazine: "Phillip is renowned for snubbing people. He's very passive-aggressive. It's up to Ruth to say how she felt, but I was feeling hurt for her.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM4n-jTGt9c data-wc=37>"No one would have snubbed me like that.
