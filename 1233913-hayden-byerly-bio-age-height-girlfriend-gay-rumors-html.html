By 2012, he had begun making appearances in a recurring role and had starred in five episodes by 2014. It was not long before the young star began to expand his body of work by venturing into <a href=# title="Hayden Byerly career" rel="nofollow noopener">voice acting roles</a>. His voice was used in video games such as <i>Lightning Returns</i>: <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i>, <i>Lego Marvel's Avengers</i>, and <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</i>. Moreover, he voiced a character in Sofia the First, an animated series where he played Prince Gustav.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a3d287cdaeebd12d.jpg><p class=align-left>He ended his first two years in the acting scene by further escalating his resume with a range of projects. In 2013, he climbed further and was assigned the role of a lead cast member of <i>The Fosters</i>, where he played the character Jude Adams Foster. His controversial role of the adopted 12-year-old boy who faced abuse received critical acclaim. The most notable one is when <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hollywood.com listed his name</a> among the Favorite LGBTQ Characters on TV due to his convincing nature and human attributes. It is this character portrayal that sparked Hayden Byerly gay rumours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ca447a24fb8eb2f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Davido shows off impressive table tennis skills as he plays against celebrity jeweller</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Just like most young actors, his education runs on a set of requirements for young actors and actresses. Acting aside, his other interests include reading mystery and action adventure books as well as playing video games and basketball. He also loves making himself busy with a little mathematics. He may still be young and somewhat inexperienced, but he never shies away from voicing different social issues such as bullying in schools. Notably, he is among the outspoken supporters of the campaign ‘<a id=https://www.customink.com/fundraising/staytruetoyou href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Be Good to Each Other</a>’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a4eaf16e7f94c7c3.jpg><h2>Hayden’s family and girlfriend</h2><p class=align-left>It is quite puzzling how some actors manage to keep their families hidden from the limelight, and Hayden is no exception.

Hayden knows this very well, and he has been subject to gay rumours ever since he played the James Foster role. However, this information is wrong as the star vehemently denied the rumours and affirmed that he is straight in real life.</p><h2>Hayden Byerly’s wealth information</h2><p class=align-left>At the moment, there is no much information regarding the actor’s net worth.
