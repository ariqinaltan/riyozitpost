She sent some of these:</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

One annoying thing about dating is that guys who don't act anywhere near as obsessive as Stacy get labeled as "coming on too strong" because women are very sensitive to this in the beginning.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a1987/when-does-persistence-pay-080727/>Trust me, by now I've learned to just text/call once and then give up so that I don't overwhelm in the early stages</a>.</p><p>I get a lot of hand-holding from my girl friends behind the curtain: They tell me to tread lightly in the beginning so that I don't look weird.</p><p>Among the many "rules" my girl friends tell me to follow:</p><p>In addition to the advice given to me by my many female handlers, I've heard from these same girls things guys do to come on too strong:</p><p>There must be a point where it becomes acceptable to start giving a girl more attention, and I guess it varies for everyone. I never know when it's the right time for this.</p><p>Here's the frustrating part:&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/sex-love/a2518/men-stereotypes-women-2/>I hear women complain that a guy is coming on too strong</a>...and then complain that a guy is not giving them enough attention. There's some magic (and usually impossible to find) button in the middle somewhere that a guy has to push.</p><p>Sadly, I'm at the point where I know my chances are best if I look like I'm not thinking about a girl too much. This is my default move, because I know if I come on strong, or tell a girl I actually like her, my chances will die.</p><p>Maybe the guy who comes on too strong kills all his mystery — and I admit we all like a little mystery.</p><p>Is it boring when it's "too easy"? Do we all expect a little game to be played? Is it necessary to be vague to compel a girl in the beginning? Why do you dislike when a guy comes on too strong, and what are things they do to come on too strong?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaKuVrXqtu9WeZpptY2d9cK3RnmSyp6VisLC5yKeeZqeeYsGwu4ysq6unnpx8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./euros-recipe-ideas-hosting-menu.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best food ideas for Euros parties: Euros hosting recipes: from grilled halloumi skewers to irresisti</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cole-barnett-and-zanab-jaffrey-are-these-annoying-love-is-blind-stars-still-together.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Are These Annoying Love Is Blind Stars Still Together?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
