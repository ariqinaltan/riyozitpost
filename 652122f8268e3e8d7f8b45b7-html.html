However, it seems that his future is not entirely clear, as he could leave his club, <strong>LAFC</strong>, after failing to reach an agreement for his renewal.</p><p>This has only increased the possibility of the striker leaving US soccer. This could bring him back to Mexico so he can finally make his debut in Liga MX.</p><p>Despite this, <strong>Vela </strong>remains focused with <strong><a href=#>LAFC </a></strong>for what lies ahead. He is about to start the MLS post-season in search of a new title.</p><p>It should be remembered that <strong>LAFC </strong>is the current champion of the American league. That is why they remain as one of the favorites to lift the cup that accredits them as champions for the second time in their short history.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Vela could leave Los Angeles FC</h2><p>According to information from Record and AS, <strong>Vela </strong>is far from reaching an agreement with <strong>LAFC</strong>'s management to extend his stay in California.</p><p>That is why the club's fans have already begun to express themselves on social networks to demand that the necessary effort be made so that the former Mexican international striker can continue where he became a legend, having arrived as the franchise player and the visible face after his good time in Europe, mainly in his last stage, which he impressed in LaLiga leading <strong>Real Sociedad</strong>.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Chivas or Rayados could be Vela's destination</h2><p>While waiting for what happens with <strong>Vela</strong>'s possible agreement or his possible departure, Mexican soccer is already starting to rub its hands together. This is due to the fact that there are two clubs that are extremely interested in the left-footed attacker being part of their projects.</p><p>They are <strong>Chivas Rayadas del Guadalajara</strong> and <strong>Rayados del Monterrey</strong>. The former would like to make an economic effort to give Vela a good contract, remembering that he is one of their youth players. Despite that, it is also worth noting that he never made his debut with the red and white jersey, as he was sold at the age of 16 to <strong>Arsenal</strong>, of the Premier League, after being considered the best U-17 player when the Mexico Men's National Team won the World Cup of the category in 2005.</p><p>On the other hand, La Pandilla would like to have <strong>Vela </strong>in their squad to add to the stars they already have. For fans, it would be very interesting to see an attack formed by <strong>Vela </strong>and <strong>Jesus Corona</strong>.</p><p>That is why time will tell what will happen with <strong>Vela</strong>, one of the most talented Mexican players of recent times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jp%2BmqKySlrmte8ylqmhqYGeAcH2PaGdwZ2Zqf3J%2BkZ9va25omoCmhMNwnXGaZGqveHrHraSl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rico-swavey-patrick-fakoya.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rico Swavey (Patrick Fakoya) Wiki, Biography, Age, Wife, Parents, Net worth, Death News &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./net-worth-2024-of-stevie-wonder.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Net Worth 2024 Of Stevie Wonder</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
