The Grammy-nominated singer has not only garnered a massive following, she has also recorded numerous awards and accolades, both as an individual singer and for various collaborations.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography and age</span></strong></h2><p><span>The singer was born Elena Jane Goulding on December 30, 1986 in Hereford, England.&nbsp;Ellie and her three siblings were mostly raised by her mother after her biological father left the family when she was still a 5-year-old girl.&nbsp;She described her father, who came from a family of undertakers, obsessed with murder.</span></p><p><span>The difficulty of her childhood continued even after her mother, Tracy Goulding married a second time.&nbsp;Although Goulding didn’t reveal many details about the kind of man her stepfather was, she said he was completely awful and she wouldn’t mind punching him in the face if she had to. meet him again.&nbsp;Just like her biological father, her stepfather also left her mother.&nbsp;Good riddance in his opinion.</span></p><p><span>Goulding who had grown to love music and musical instruments attended Lady Hawkins Secondary School, where she moved to the University of Kent.&nbsp;She did not complete her university education, as she was forced to drop out of school and pursue a full-time career in music.&nbsp;Before that, she also attended Hereford Sixth Form College.</span></p><h2><strong><span>The music</span></strong></h2><p><span>The first single she released,&nbsp;</span><span>Sous la Feuille</span><span>&nbsp;(2009) was very successful, so by 2010 she had dropped her debut album,&nbsp;</span><span>Lumières</span><span>&nbsp;which went on to chart double platinum.&nbsp;Previously, she had already made a name for herself by winning the&nbsp;</span><span>British Sound of…</span><span>&nbsp;award which was won by the likes of 50 Cent in 2003 and Adele in 2008.</span></p><p><span>In 2012 she released&nbsp;</span><span>Alcyon</span><span>&nbsp;(with 3 platinum) as her second studio album and it was followed in 2015 by&nbsp;</span><span>Délire</span><span>&nbsp;which went platinum as well.</span></p><p><span>After a career that has seen her so far, Ellie Goulding, who works with the likes of Tinie Tempah and Calvin Harris, has been nominated for more than sixty awards, including the Grammy.&nbsp;</span><span>Love me like you do</span><span>.&nbsp;She has also won numerous awards such as Cosmopolitan’s Ultimate Woman of the Year Awards, Jimmie Awards, People’s Choice Awards, and Q Awards.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is Ellie Goulding&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Dating?&nbsp;– Boyfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>When it comes to relationships, EllieGoulding has had her own share of it all.&nbsp;She has been linked to more men than the fingers of two hands can represent.&nbsp;One of the very big names she has dated is Prince Harry.&nbsp;Although the relationship didn’t last long, it was certainly high profile.</span></p><p><span>Another person she has dated is English radio presenter, Greg James.&nbsp;The two were together from 2009 to 2011, when they broke up.&nbsp;The next disciple was American Disc Jockey, Skrillex.&nbsp;After this relationship, Goulding dated British actor Jeremy Irvine from 2012 to 2013.</span></p><p><span>In 2013, the singer dated Calvin Harris, EdSheeran and Niall Horan of One Direction with whom she allegedly cheated on Ed Sheeran.&nbsp;According to many, this is what led to the publication of Ed Sheeran’s book.&nbsp;</span><span>Not</span><span>&nbsp;as well as Goulding’s&nbsp;</span><span>In My Thoughts</span><span>, though she strenuously denied it had anything to do with the relationship.</span></p><p><span>It was also rumored that she had gone out with an English singer, Luke Friend.&nbsp;That same year, Ellie started dating Dougie Poynter.&nbsp;The relationship continued until 2016 before falling apart like others before it.&nbsp;The same year, she began a romantic affair with Bobby, her next boyfriend.</span></p><p><span>Towards the end of 2017, the electronic pop singer then turned to Caspar Jopling, a New York-based art dealer.&nbsp;In the second half of 2018, the two were still together.</span></p><p><span>There are a number of other men who have been rumored to have had a relationship with Goulding in the past as well, although the relationships were hardly serious.&nbsp;These include fitness instructor Sam Karl and DJ Burns.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Body dimensions and height</span></strong></h2><p><span>With almost no argument, Ellie is a very beautiful woman that many men, as evident in the number of men she has dated, wish they had.&nbsp;As a natural brunette, she prefers to wear blonde hair and she has dark eyes.</span></p><p><span>Regarding her body, she has a height of 5 feet 5 inches (165 cm) and a body measurement of 56 kg (123.5 pounds).&nbsp;As is the case with her measurements, she registers between 89 and 66-89 cm and her dress size is 6 (US) or 38 (EU).&nbsp;Her bra size is 32C while her shoe size is 8.5 (US) or 39 (EU).</span></p><p class=postsid
