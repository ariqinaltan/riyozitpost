was under the category "AWARDS & HONORS."</p><p>It read: "As of 2023 the only 2 to win a Nobel Prize in Literature & an Academy Award were George Bernard Shaw & this singer-songwriter."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>John was incorrect as he wrote “Bob” but left the rest of the answer blowing in the wind, as was Steve, who went all-in with “Margret Mitchell.”</p><p>Only Jilana was correct with “Bob Dylan,” but she surprised fans when she revealed she bet $801.</p><p>She will advance to the semifinals with $19,801 and looked beside herself with relief.</p><p>However, if Steve had been correct and she had been wrong, she wouldn't have won.</p><p>If Steve were right, she would have lost, having not properly cover-bet or ensuring she’d still win (the right bet would have been $201).</p><p>If she were wrong, she would have dropped to $18,199.</p><p>Steve would have had $19,200 and won solely due to her math.</p><h2>'MISTAKE ON PUBLIC DISPLAY'</h2><p>Jilana took to a <a href=#>Reddit</a> forum to avoid any bad buzz about her wager.</p><p>She wrote: “I didn't realize until today that I'd made a math error on my FJ wager.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's embarrassing, but because it's not as fast-paced as the rest of the game I find it much more stressful and I seem to be more prone to errors then.</p><p>“FJ is by far the hardest part of the game for me because I don't have the momentum that I do during the earlier rounds.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn't know that Bob Dylan had an Oscar, but I remembered there being some controversy about him getting the Nobel prize in literature and I definitely didn't know of any other singer-songwriters who had one, so he seemed like the most likely answer to me.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's tough to have your mistakes on public display!&nbsp;</p><p>“My fellow players from the diamonds bracket have been immensely supportive and encouraging and I'm so, so grateful.&nbsp;</p><p>“It sounds cliché, but especially playing in a multi-day tournament like this gave us a wonderful opportunity to bond and we keep in touch now.&nbsp;</p><p>“No matter how aggressive we might seem while playing, that all turns off as soon as we're done. There are lots of smiles, laughter, and encouragement during the commercial breaks.”</p><p>One fan replied: "Just wanted to say you did excellent today, and I hope you do even better in the next round!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/announced-full-schedule-lineup-brand-853465772-2.jpg><h2>WHAT IS: CHAMPIONS WILDCARD?</h2><p>Jeopardy!'s 40th season premiered on September 11 and runs until late July 2024.</p><p>Champions Wildcard has invited back a massive 108 past players and is a brand new tournament.</p><p>Each leg of the special will feature 27 contestants, with nine quarterfinals, three semifinals, and a two-part final where one winner will emerge.</p><p>Then, the slate is wiped clean, with each leg running for three weeks.</p><p>There will be four winners by the time Champions Wildcard ends on December 18.</p><p>The purse is four&nbsp;$100,000 prizes and a slot in the&nbsp;2023 Tournament of Champions.</p><p>Contestant&nbsp;Josh Saak&nbsp;became the first of four winners last week, and the event is now in its second group of quarterfinalists.</p><p>The 2023&nbsp;Tournament of Champions, where last season's stars like&nbsp;<a href=#>Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hannah Wilson&nbsp;await, begins on December 19.</p><h2>WHERE IS: MAYIM BIALIK?</h2><p>Fans may want to know when Ken's counterpart,&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>, 47, will be back.</p><p><a href=#>Ken&nbsp;is hosting</a> almost the entire season solo, and&nbsp;Mayim&nbsp;is not involved as it stands.</p><p>She bowed out as a member of Saf-Aftra, a big shakeup since she and Ken were tapped to split hosting in 2022 after&nbsp;<a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>'s tragic&nbsp;death.</p><p>"It’s not for me to personally judge anyone else’s decision [but] I am a union supporter," Mayim told Vanity Fair last month in her&nbsp;<a href=#>first public statement.</a></p><p>"There’s a lot of complexity to this, but my general statement is always that I come from a union family."</p><p>Mayim's absence has also put a more overarching issue into the forefront: many <a href=#>fans prefer Ken alone as the host</a>.</p><p>"[Mayim] is unwatchable with none of the personality that Ken brings to the show," a fan recently wrote on&nbsp;X.</p><p>"Love Ken Jennings, I Hope & He The Only Host Going Forward!" another post read.</p><p>A third recently posted: "It Takes More Than Being Smart To Host Jeopardy. The Powers That Be Should Announce They Were Mistaken To Hire Hollyweird To Host Jeopardy."</p><p>Mayim's return date to the show is still unknown, but it will likely not be until April when new contestants resume.</p><h2>WHEN WILL: 'NORMAL' EPISODES BE BACK?</h2><p>Jeopardy! redid its schedule when deciding to continue despite Hollywood's Strikes (and<a href=#> a lot of backlash</a>).</p><p>The <a href=#>game show</a> threw in placeholder tournaments, not knowing how long the strikes would be.</p><p>Since the&nbsp;Season 40&nbsp;premiere last month, Jeopardy! has been pulling contestants from past seasons and using old clues and clues that were previously written but never aired.</p><p>This was a way around the WGA strike since Jeopardy! was without its writers; the WGA strike was resolved last month.</p><p>Showrunner&nbsp;<a href=#>Michael Davies</a>&nbsp;defended on the&nbsp;“Inside Jeopardy!” <a href=#>podcast</a>&nbsp;that it “wouldn’t be fair to have new contestants making their first appearance” on the show with material that isn’t original or that was written pre-strike.</p><p>"The material that we’re gonna be using is a combination of material that our WGA writers wrote before the strike, which is still in the database and material that is being redeployed from multiple, multiple seasons of the show.”</p><p>As a result, past player tournaments have ensued, with all regular programming being pushed aside for quite some time.</p><p>This 2023 ToC will be longer than in years past and feature its own Second Chance competition, another Champions Wildcard, and finally, the actual ToC.</p><p>So, there will be little room for new contestants or&nbsp;"normal episodes"&nbsp;this season.</p><p>Execs explained the&nbsp;overhauled timeline on the podcast, admitting tournament play is the "Number one priority" and "We will have 16 weeks of regular episodes at the end of the year."</p><p>That means we won't see new contestants until April, with just four months of regular play this year out of 11 months.</p><p>Not all fans are sold on the big change, as one recently vented: "I am sick of the current tournaments. BRING BACK REGULAR PLAY, PLEASE!"</p><p>"Oh my god, is it really until April? That's absolutely wild," wrote another.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>However, others have argued that this Jeopardy! is better than no Jeopardy!.</p><p>Come April, returning champion Lucas Partridge will return after nearly a year off, as, theoretically, will Mayim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/huge-room-hidden-behind-wall-854683743.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/host-official-poster-fans-say-841061689-11.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/s-mayim-bialik-breaks-silence-831338890-14.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGWFcYOSaKGep6CWv6XFjKOgpZmelnqku9OtnKtlnZ7Ata3KnmStp6Wnu6K5xKerZq%2BZo7umvoytpqehl53BcA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-jewellery-special-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton gifted stunning new jewellery for sweet reason</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-jesse-watters-still-on-the-five.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Jesse Watters still on The Five?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
