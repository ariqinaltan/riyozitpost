He was 59.</p><p>Davis and Franken, who began writing jokes as teenagers in a Minneapolis private school, were spotted doing stand-up in Los Angeles by SNL creator <strong>Lorne Michaels</strong>. He hired them as a team for the late-night NBC show before its debut season in 1975, and they began by splitting one apprentice writer’s salary of $350 a week.</p><p><strong><a href=#>PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Notable Deaths of 2012</a></strong></p><p>“Tom was one of the writers who created SNL,” Michaels said in a statement.&nbsp;“He was there from the beginning. No one saw things the way that Tom did. He was funny, he was original and he was always there to help no matter the hour. And I always trusted his laugh. I can still kinda hear it.”</p><p>Among the famous SNL sketches that Davis is credited with were “The Coneheads,” about a family of aliens with huge craniums who come to Earth to observe everyday life; one with <strong>Dan Aykroyd</strong> as <strong>Julia Child</strong> trying to remain calm as she bleeds profusely while preparing a holiday chicken; another with <strong>Bill Murray</strong> playing a lounge singer who ad-libs lyrics to wordless songs like the Star Wars theme; and “The Continental,” a sketch with frequent SNL guest <strong>Christopher Walken</strong> as a hopeless ladies man.</p><p>Franken remembered Davis as someone who loved to laugh.</p><p>“Today is a sad day for all of us who loved Tom. I spoke with his mom this afternoon and she recalled fondly all the laughter that would come from the basement when Tom and I first got started in comedy,” Franken said in a statement. “I visited Tom two weeks ago, and though he was deathly ill, we did a lot of laughing. He was a great friend, a good man, and so funny.”</p><p>Longtime SNL writer <strong>Jim Downey </strong>praised Davis’ unique sense of humor.</p><p>“His ideas, unlike most ideas you hear, seemed to come out of nowhere, impossible either to predict, or to reverse-engineer,” Downey said in a statement. “He was a loyal friend, a generous and supportive collaborator and utterly unthreatened by the success or talent of those around him. His old pals have known for some time that this day was coming, but still it’s hard to accept that he’s now no longer out there, somewhere, thinking those crazy thoughts that no one else would think.”</p><p>In the early days of SNL, Davis and Franken also appeared as a comic duo. They shared Emmys for their writing on the show in 1976, 1977 and 1989 and another one for The Paul Simon Special in 1977.</p><p>Davis worked on SNL from 1975-1980, 1986-1994 and 2003. He starred with Franken in the comedy&nbsp;One More Saturday Night&nbsp;(1986) and collaborated with Aykroyd and Bonnie & Terry Turner to pen a Coneheads movie in 1993.</p><p>Davis and Franken had a falling-out in 1990 but reconciled by the time Franken was elected to the Senate from Minnesota in 2008 and after Davis had spent time in rehab for drug use.</p><p>Survivors include Mimi, his wife of 21 years, and his mother Jean.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOraamZZSWw6q%2FjLCpoqyZo7RuvMCrq6edomKurXmSbmlpcGJk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-included-in-a-midas-oil-change-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is included in a Midas oil change?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-dan-bilzerians-first-movie-role.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Dan Bilzerian's First Movie Role</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
