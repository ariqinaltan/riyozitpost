The most widely studied of these rabbinic teachings are known collectively as the Talmud, which has two parts: <a href=#>Mishnah</a> and Gemara.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Want to learn Talmud with us?

Sign up for it here!</a></strong></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mishnah</a> is the earlier work, compiled from the teachings of sages living at the end of the Second Temple period and in the century following the destruction of the Temple.</p><p>A study book of laws and value statements that express the classical <a href=#>rabbis’ vision of Judaism</a>, the Mishnah’s preoccupation is promotion of a religious and legal tradition both continuous with the past and practical for life in the post-destruction Diaspora. The Mishnah contains multiple opinions on many laws and does not often suggest which is the most authoritative. The plurality of Jewish practice is preserved in the text.</p><h2>Gemara</h2><p>Sages in both <a href=#>Babylonia</a> (modern-day Iraq) and the <a href=#>Land of Israel</a> continued to study traditional teachings, including the Mishnah, describing the teachings as having been passed down from <a href=#>Moses </a>at Sinai (either literally or figuratively). The oral discussions were preserved, either by memorization or notation, and later edited together in a manner that places generations of sages in conversation with one another. These teachers were interested in bringing greater harmonization between biblical and rabbinic traditions, largely by providing proof-texts for known laws and explaining differences between the biblical and rabbinic versions of laws. This is the origin of the Gemara.</p><h2>Babylonian vs. Palestinian</h2><p>There are actually <a href=#>two works known as “Gemara”</a>&nbsp;— the Babylonian Gemara (referred to as “<i>Bavli</i>” in Hebrew) and the Palestinian (or Jerusalem) Gemara (referred to as “<i>Yerushalmi</i>“). The term “Gemara” itself comes from the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aramaic</a> root <i>g.m.r</i> (equivalent to <i>l.m.d</i>, in Hebrew), giving it the meaning “teaching.”</p><p>Although the Yerushalmi was <a href=#>completed earlier</a> (with material spanning roughly 200-500 C.E.), it was eclipsed by the much longer Bavli (200-600 C.E.). The Bavli’s popularity may be due to the work of the Gaonim of Babylonia, who cited that work in the legal judgements (responsa) that they sent to communities throughout the Diaspora. Both Gemaras were written in a combination of <a href=#>Hebrew</a> and <a href=#>Aramaic </a>dialects and share the teachings of sages known by the term <i>Amoraim</i> (in the singular, <i>Amora</i>).</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.myjewishlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/hevruta-at-pardes.jpg></p><h2>Both Broad and Deep</h2><p>Gemara encompasses several literary genres, and subject matter ranges from the sacred to the profane. While it is often misrepresented as merely a commentary on the laws of the Mishnah, the Gemara has an intricate relationship with the Mishnah and a far greater scope. Although it is organized in accordance with the structure of the six orders of the Mishnah, mishnaic teachings are, for the Gemara, the launch pad for diverse topics: <a href=#>prayer</a>, holy days, agriculture, <a href=#>sexual habits</a>, contemporary medical knowledge, <a href=#>superstitions</a>, criminal and civil law.</p><p>The Gemara contains both <a href=#><i>halakhah</i></a> (legal material) and <a href=#><i>aggadah</i></a> (narrative material). Aggadah includes historical material, biblical commentaries, philosophy, theology, and wisdom literature. Stories reveal information about life in ancient times, among Jews and between Jews and their neighbors, and folk customs. All of these genres are blended together with the halakhic material, in what is sometimes described as a stream-of-consciousness fashion filled with meaningful tangents and digressions.</p><h2>The Relationship of Gemara to Mishnah</h2><p>In dealing with the teachings of the Mishnah, the Gemara has multiple functions. It explains unclear words or phrasing. It also provides precedents or examples to assist in application of the law and offers alternative opinions from sages of the Mishnah and their contemporaries (known as <i>Tannaim</i>). Whereas the Mishnah barely cites biblical verses, the Gemara for nearly every law discussed introduces these connections between the biblical text and the practices and legal opinions of its time. It also extends and restricts applications of various laws, and even adds laws on issues left out of the Mishnah entirely (for example, the key observances of <a href=#>Hanukkah</a>). Multiple opinions of sages are weighed against one another, often without presenting a conclusion.</p><h2>How the Gemara is Studied</h2><p>Talmudic teachings have been most often studied in groups or pairs– among masters and students and/or between two partners in learning. A pair of study partners is called a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>havruta</i></a>. The havruta-style provides a challenging, lively, and intimate environment in which to explore the rich spiritual and intellectual depths of the Talmud.</p><span class=m-tooltip__container></span><span class=m-tooltip__container></span><span class=m-tooltip__container></span><h3 class=m-newsletter__heading>Join Our Newsletter</h3><p>Empower your Jewish discovery, daily</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rsXJnq6iq5ihsqK%2BzaKloGaTpLpwrdGtoJyklWS0prnAq5hmrJiaeqa%2F0p6lnJ1dpLNuwMeeZK2ZnKLCpXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hedy-thom-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hedy Thom Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gary-valentine-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gary Valentine Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
