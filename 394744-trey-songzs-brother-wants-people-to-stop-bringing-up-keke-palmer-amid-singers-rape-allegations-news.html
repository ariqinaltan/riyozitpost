Just yesterday (February 15), we reported on Songz gettin<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">g hit with a $20 million lawsuit</a> from an anonymous accuser who alleged that she was the victim of a "brutal rape." This suit follows two others that were reportedly<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> filed in recent months </a>by women who have accused Songz of sexual assault.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The public has been dissecting the similar allegations made against Songz in recent years, and a name that continues to come up is Keke Palmer. Back In 2017, the award-winning actress shared a story about an alleged encounter she had with Songz where she claimed&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he used "sexual intimidation"</a> to force her to make an appearance in one of his music videos. Palmer alleged that things became so uncomfortable that she hid from the singer in a closet.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Palmer's name has become a hot topic once again, Songz's brother Ruski has come forward with a message. He would like for people to stop mentioning the actress because Palmer never said Songz physically harmed her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"She never accused him of rape.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">She was upset</a> that she was put in a music video when she felt she was too intoxicated!" said Ruski. "And for that I agree she has every right to not be in video she doesn't want to be in but she never said he physically or sexually assaulted her. Her term was 'sexual intimidation' not that is very serious but also very vague and it is no way an accusation of sexual assault. Furthermore there is no rape charges that have been brought against him....NONE."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ruski went on to say that all of the allegations are "from the SAME LAWYER" and denied that Songz has "all these rape allegations when he doesn't." He advised people to revisit Palmer's video where she&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">shared the story</a> of her interaction with Songz to double down that the actress never accused the singer of sexual assault.
