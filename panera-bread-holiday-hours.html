It was founded in 1987 by Ronald Shaich and Louis Kane. It is known for its sandwiches, soups, salads, and bakery items, as well as its commitment to using natural and organic ingredients.</p><p>The company operates over 2,000 locations in the United States and Canada and has a strong presence in the Eastern and Midwest regions of the United States. In addition to its in-store dining options, Panera also offers catering services, as well as delivery through its partnerships with third-party delivery platforms such as Grubhub and DoorDash.</p><p>Read more: <a href=#>Get Paid to Read Books</a></p><h3><span id=Reducing_environmental_impact8230>Reducing environmental impact…</span></h3><p>They have a strong focus on sustainability and social responsibility and have made several efforts to reduce their environmental impact. This includes sourcing its coffee and tea from Rainforest Alliance Certified farms and using recycled materials in its packaging.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also has several initiatives in place to support some of the communities in which it operates. This includes its Panera Cares program, which offers pay-what-you-can meals to those in need.</p><h3><span id=Normal_Operating_Hours>Normal Operating Hours</span></h3><p><strong>Panera Bread operates from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Mondays through Saturdays</strong>. This means that you can stop by for a quick breakfast or lunch before work or take a break from your busy day to enjoy a delicious meal. You can also visit in the evening for dinner or a late-night snack.</p><p>On Sundays, Panera Bread has slightly shorter hours, operating from 7:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. This is still plenty of time to stop by for a hearty breakfast or a leisurely lunch, but you may want to plan your dinner earlier in the day.</p><h3><span id=All_locations_vary8230>All locations vary…</span></h3><p>It’s worth noting that their operating hours may vary depending on location, so it’s always a good idea to check with your local restaurant to confirm their hours of operation. You can check&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the company’s website</a>&nbsp;or call ahead to make sure you know when you can visit the location nearest to you.</p><h2><span id=Panera_Bread_Holiday_Hours>Panera Bread Holiday Hours</span></h2><p>It’s that time of year again – the holiday season is upon us, and many people are looking for information on store hours for their favorite businesses. If you&nbsp;<strong>plan on visiting Panera Bread</strong>, you’ll be happy to know that the general holiday hours for the popular chain are the same as regular-day hours.</p><p>That means that you can still enjoy your favorite soups, sandwiches, and pastries on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Labor Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, etc., at the same times as you normally would. Whether you need a quick breakfast on the go or a sit-down dinner with friends and family.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Panera-Bread-Holiday-Hours.png alt="Panera Bread Holiday Hours" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Check_ahead_to_be_safe8230>Check ahead to be safe…</span></h3><p>Of course, it’s always a good idea to double-check the hours of your local Panera Bread location before heading out. Some locations may have modified hours due to the holiday season, so it’s best to be safe and call ahead or check online.</p><h2><span id=Specific_Hours_For_Major_Holidays>Specific Hours For Major Holidays</span></h2><h3><span id=Christmas_Eve_and_Christmas_Day>Christmas Eve and Christmas Day</span></h3><p>On Christmas Eve, they operate during normal business hours and close at the usual time. However, on&nbsp;<strong>Christmas Day, all Panera Bread locations are closed</strong>.</p><p>While it can be disappointing to find out that a favorite restaurant is closed on a holiday, it is important to remember that the employees also deserve to have time off to celebrate the holiday with their families and loved ones.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Specific-Hours-For-Major-Holidays.png alt="Specific Hours For Major Holidays" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=New_Years_Eve_and_New_Years_Day>New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day</span></h3><p>While some businesses may choose to close early or operate on a reduced schedule on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, this is not typically the case for Panera Bread. Customers can expect to be able to visit their local and enjoy their favorite menu items at the same times as they would on any other day of the year.</p><p>In addition to offering their usual menu items,&nbsp;<strong>Panera Bread may also offer special promotions or deals on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day</strong>&nbsp;to celebrate the holiday.</p><h3><span id=Spoiling_their_customers8230>Spoiling their customers…</span></h3><p>These promotions can take many different forms, including discounts on certain items, special deals on gift cards or other products, and limited-time offers on services or products. Customers are encouraged to check with their local Panera Bread location for more information on any special offers that may be available.</p><h3><span id=Thanksgiving_Day>Thanksgiving Day</span></h3><p><strong>Panera Bread will be closed on Thanksgiving day</strong>, just like it is every year. This decision to close on this holiday is a tradition for the popular bakery-café chain, and it’s one that they take very seriously.</p><p>While it might be inconvenient for some customers not to have access to their favorite Panera Bread dishes on Thanksgiving. Panera Bread is showing its commitment to its employees and their families, and it’s a gesture that is much appreciated by its hardworking staff. On the bright side, this store closing gives you more time to focus on cooking your own Thanksgiving feast or trying out some new recipes.</p><h2><span id=Online_And_Mobile_Ordering_During_the_Holiday_Season>Online And Mobile Ordering During the Holiday Season</span></h2><p>During the holiday season, many people are busy with work, family gatherings, and holiday-related activities. This can make it difficult to find the time to sit down and enjoy a meal at a restaurant, which is where online and mobile ordering can come in handy.</p><p>Fortunately, Panera Bread offers a range of online and mobile ordering options that make it easy for customers to get their favorite dishes, including on holiday days when the restaurant is open.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ncesc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Online-And-Mobile-Ordering-During-the-Holiday-Season.png alt="Online And Mobile Ordering During the Holiday Season" width=1200 height=630 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span id=Delivery_and_curbside_pick_up8230>Delivery and curbside pick up…</span></h3><p>Customers can use the app or&nbsp;<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>&nbsp;to place an order for delivery to their home or office. This is a convenient option for those who don’t have time to stop by the restaurant in person or who simply prefer to have their meals delivered.</p><p>In addition to delivery, Panera Bread also offers curbside pickup and rapid pickup options for customers who prefer to pick up their orders in person. Both of these options allow customers to place an order online or via the app and then pick up their order at a designated location at the restaurant.
