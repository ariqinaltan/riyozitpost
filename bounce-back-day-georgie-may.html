Accept the bad day</strong></h3><p id=efmkLyiWNgPV data-wc=23>The first step to bouncing back from an unlucky day is to accept that you are having an unlucky day. Acceptance is key.</p><p id=ehQPLO_B4r data-wc=15>Suffering arises when we struggle against reality, rather than acknowledging and embracing it with acceptance.</p><p id=eXFeBK7-MrQc data-wc=30>We need to accept what we're going through, including pain and discomfort.

Reflect</strong></h3><p id=eUQmFXDkAHRA data-wc=14>Take a moment to reflect on the events that unfolded during your unlucky day.</p><p id=edu752txquGe data-wc=48>After accepting, maybe spend some time writing down your thoughts and identify any patterns or habits that may have contributed to your challenges.

It can be as simple as appreciating the birds singing or the fact you have food on the table. This shift in perspective creates a positive feedback loop, where focusing on the good attracts more of it, perpetuating the cycle of positivity.</p><h3><strong>4. Prioritise self-care</strong></h3><p id=ewp8d_F11tse data-wc=25>After a series of unfortunate events, it's crucial to prioritise self-care.
