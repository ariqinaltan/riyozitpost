If you don't make it complete, you can't win 0-4 here," Ancelotti said.</p><p>"In the first half we had difficulties but the first goal changes the dynamics of the whole match.</p><p>"It's a game in which personality and experience is a very important aspect. We mixed the energy of Rodrygo, Valverde and Camavinga with the experience of Vini, Modric, Kroos. They played a spectacular game."</p><p>After suffering at the hands of Barcelona this season, it was a spectacular riposte by Ancelotti's side as Real beat Barca by at least a four-goal margin for the first time since 1995.</p><p>Real are a distant second behind Barca in La Liga having lost 2-1 to their bitter rival last month. But while the title may be gone, they regained bragging rights in style.</p><p>There was no hint of what was to come on Wednesday as Barcelona looked in the mood to kill the tie with Thibaut Courtois thwarting the hosts on a number of occasions.</p><p>It was from one Courtois save to deny Robert Lewandowski that the tie turned in an instant.</p><p>Real broke forward at pace and Vinicius exchanged passes with Benzema before his shot crept over the line despite the efforts of defender Ronald Araujo to keep it out.</p><p>Five minutes after the break Modric glided in from the right and rolled a pass to Benzema to send a precise finish into the corner. Xavi's Barcelona were in tatters minutes later when Vinicius was fouled and Benzema exacted punishment.</p><p>Tempers flared with players from both sides getting involved in skirmishes but Benzema had the last laugh to complete a magical night for Real and one Barca will want to forget.</p><p>"Congratulations to Real Madrid, who had a great second half," Barca coach Xavi, who was booked in the first half, said. "If you show Madrid mercy, they don't show you mercy.</p><p>"It will be hard to sleep, as I am from Barcelona and many of the squad are. But tomorrow, we think about Girona (next match in Lal Liga)."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e8Wopq2akaG5cH6Pa2poaGRkfXd7wZ6ls52dlnqprdNmq6uhk6B6sbvWnqmsZaKarq15zJqbq6GUYr2iv9NmmZqqk5Z6qrrTqGScp6CWeqWxy2apnrFdm7avrctnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-lively-denim-chanel-bag.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Livelys 6,500 Denim Chanel Bag is a Cool-Girl Must-Have</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./austin-rivers-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Austin Rivers Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
