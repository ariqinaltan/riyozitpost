Plants labeled part shade are going to be more sensitive to getting too much sun, particularly in the afternoon, and will need shade during the hottest parts of the day.<h2>Why is morning sun the best?</h2>Exposure to full spectrum sunlight in the morning causes our bodies to produce serotonin, which not only helps later on with nighttime sleep, but improves mood throughout the day.
