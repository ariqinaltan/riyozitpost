(Who thought it would be possible to actually miss the days of terrible Tinder hookups?) Good news: Whether you’re looking for steamy audio erotica to carry you away or just craving a little real talk on sex from a friendly voice, there’s a podcast for that. From advice programs and talk shows, erotic drama to long-form nonfiction, we’ve rounded up the steamiest sex-centered podcasts on the web for when you’re feeling frisky.</p><h2 data-node-id=1 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Dirty Diana</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Produced by (and starring) <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a33486432/demi-moore-shana-feste-dirty-diana-clip/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Demi Moore" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Demi Moore</a>, this splashy new narrative fiction series is the biggest name on the audio erotica block. Moore stars as Diana, a woman stuck in a sexless marriage, who secretly runs a website featuring sexy audio confessions from anonymous women (played by the likes of Melanie Griffith) on the side.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Turn On</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Turn On calls itself “a podcast for Black people who want to get off,” but that doesn’t begin to sum up the variety of content covered on this explicit talk show. Every week, hosts Erica and Kenrya read some sexy Black erotica alongside sharing tips, tricks, and TMI on their own sex lives. The podcast also features interviews with authors and advocates on everything from being a sugar baby to having sex while disabled.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Sexually Liberated Woman</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hosted by sexuality doula Ev’Yan Whitney, this biweekly podcast—featuring open, vulnerable conversations about sexuality with experts and real women alike—is pretty much exactly what it says on the tin. With recent episodes spotlighting topics like shame-free masturbation and what it’s like to intentionally live apart from your spouse, Whitney’s frank, welcoming approach makes for a listening experience that is both comforting and empowering.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Dying for Sex</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After learning that she has stage 4 breast cancer, an unhappily married woman leaves her husband to embark on a sex odyssey. No, it’s not the plot of a novel by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpercollins.com/blogs/authors/jodi-picoult data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jodi Picoult" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jodi Picoult</a> or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a15336/me-before-you-trailer/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jojo Moyes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Jojo Moyes</a>—it’s the true story behind Wondery’s new six-part podcast, in which host Nikki Boyer sits down with her terminally ill friend Molly to talk about sex, dates, and “feeling alive” when you’re dying. It’s a can’t-miss.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Sex with Strangers: A Grown Folks Podcast</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When a podcast boasts episodes with names like “Spit in My Mouth” and “Celibacy with Strangers” (which are among the more SFW titles), you know you’re in for a rollicking good time. Every week, hosts Cii, Jaxon, and Juice get into it on a variety of sex- and dating-related topics. Come for the raunchy real talk; stay for the hosts’ insane chemistry and laugh-out-loud banter.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Fangasm</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you, too, experienced your sexual awakening via <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.fanfiction.net/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=FanFiction.net class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">FanFiction.net</a>, this podcast—originally launched with a (literally) explicit Harry Potter theme under the name Potterotica—is a must-listen. Since its early days, the podcast has branched out into fandoms such as Game of Thrones and now Star Wars, but the basic format remains the same: Each episode, hosts Allie, Lyndsay, and Danny get together to read and discuss a brand-new dose of smutty, smutty fanfic.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Caravan</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This narrative drama pod describes itself as a “weird-West audio adventure,” and we cannot think of a better way to put it. When Samir stumbles into a hidden world populated by paranormal creatures, he joins a caravan of bounty hunters and vigilantes in pursuit of a way out. It’s steamy, it’s sexy, it’s queer, and it’s delightfully odd.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">D Is for Desire</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">What does it mean to desire something? On this HuffPost podcast, host Noah Michelson endeavors to find out the answer. Every episode, Michelson does research and interviews guests about a different type or facet of desire (past episode topics have included period sex, asexuality, and erotic witchcraft). The result: a listening experience that’s totally shameless—in the best way possible.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Thirst Aid Kit</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The days of thirsting after your celeb crushes in the isolation of your teenage bedroom are not over: Enter Bim Adewunmi and Nichole Perkins’ long-running podcast dedicated to celebrity desire and lusting out loud. We’re talking extensive discussion, the occasional celebrity guest (Chris Evans even joined them for their episode on him!), and—yes—on-air readings of real-person fan fiction. Want to know if they’ve covered your fave? Check their archives. If not, well, guess you’ll just have to subscribe.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Once Upon a Time… in the Valley</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Self-described as a real-life version of “if Boogie Nights had a three-way with Gone Girl and A Star Is Born,” this particular Once Upon a Time… is a “porno-noir” true story set in the 1980s adult entertainment industry. Back then, Traci Lords was the biggest porn star in the game—until an FBI raid revealed that she had gotten her start at age 15, which meant that most of her films were underage porn and were therefore illegal. The industry was nearly ruined, and everyone openly wondered whether Lords was the victim or the villain. More than 30 years later, one question still haunts the business: Who called the FBI?</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Sex Out Loud with Tristan Taormino</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If you want to get the goods straight from a sexpert, look no further than this podcast hosted by sex educator and polyamory advocate Tristan Taormino. Featuring interviews with poets, doctors, and sex doulas alongside erotic cultural analyses and intensely personal #MeToo accounts, Sex Out Loud explores every angle of what it means to be a sexual being in the world.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Dreamboy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Welcome to Night Vale meets audio porn, and also a killer zebra, in this Night Vale Presents podcast, a surreal and sexy story about a musician and zoo worker in Cleveland named Dane who’s trying (and mostly failing) not to waste all his time on Grindr. I know, it doesn’t exactly sound like the most salacious setup, but trust us: The show maintains a balance between the eerie and the ethereal as it weaves wisps of Dane’s erotic dreams into the central story, which is set in a heightened, carnival-esque reality.</p><h2 data-node-id=38 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Dear Jessamyn</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Looking for a podcast focused on sex and love advice? Then Dear Jessamyn, hosted by celebrated body-positivity advocate Jessamyn Stanley and her partner, Ashe Danger Phoenix, is your bag. Season 1, released this past February, is all about polyamory and how to tell if it is—or isn’t!—right for you.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Inner Hoe Uprising</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Get in, ho, we’re reclaiming unapologetic female sexuality. Hosted by four Black queer 20-somethings in NYC, Inner Hoe Uprising covers everything from “new relationship energy” and love addiction to STI stigma and the movement for sex workers’ rights. Tune in for an urgent, infectiously joyful listening experience.</p><h2 data-node-id=44 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The Heart</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We’ve featured its relaunch as one of this year’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a33419874/best-podcasts-2020/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="best new shows" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">best new shows</a>, but we’re talking about The Heart again here—both the old seasons and the new version—because it’s just that good. Originally titled Audio Smut, The Heart (self-described as “an audio art project about intimacy and humanity”) is a wildly experimental ride through topics like consent, desire, and body ownership. Featuring first-person accounts of love and sex augmented by out-of-the-box sound design, it’s the most visceral experience you’ll ever find in podcast form.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/3ac58a4f-5cbc-4003-9811-5f7e18b418a4_1585686898.png alt="Headshot of Keely Weiss" title="Headshot of Keely Weiss" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Keely Weiss is a writer and filmmaker.
