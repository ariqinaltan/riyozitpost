It’s the first time that Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino and his wife Lauren have brought their new baby Romeo along.</p><p>During one of the episodes, first-time mom Lauren was struggling to stay awake at the dinner table and appeared snippy with the waiter and her costars. She kept saying she was ready to leave and then pointed out that she had a baby that required 24-hour care.</p><p>In a separate clip, Lauren was seen snapping her fingers to get the attention of the wait staff. A move that caught Deena Cortese off guard as she said during a confessional that she never realized how high maintenance Lauren was.</p><p>Fans are not used to seeing this side of Lauren and several of them took to social media to share that they weren’t loving the way she’s been acting.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jersey Shore Family Vacation fans slam Lauren Sorrentino for her behavior</h2><p>Jersey Shore Family Vacation fans are surprised to see the way Lauren has been acting for the past few episodes.</p><p>Many of them took to social media to share their opinions of what’s been happening.</p><p>One fan said, “I’m not liking [Lauren] this season” and felt she didn’t “want to have fun.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fans-react-to-Laurens-behavior.-Pic-credit_-@ItsJodyToYou_Twitter.jpg><p>A separate critic thought Lauren was getting “too big for her britches” and said she needed to be “reminded of her place!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fans-react-to-Laurens-behavior.-Pic-credit_-@CcM16522419_Twitter.jpg><p>One viewer felt that Lauren was being “super stank” throughout the vacation but had a little more grace for her considering she has been adjusting to being a new mom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Fans-react-to-Laurens-behavior.-Pic-credit_-@JMoBrock_Twitter.jpg><p>Even though Lauren had appeared to rub Deena the wrong way, they seemed to get past it pretty quickly as the episodes have progressed. Deena even made a joke about Lauren being high maintenance and referred to her as “bougie” on the most recent episode.</p><p>Lauren took the comment in stride and even joked about it on her own Twitter page.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jersey Shore’s Lauren Sorrentino stars her own skincare line</h2><p>Regardless of the way Lauren has been portrayed this season, she continues to stay positive both through social media and her podcast that she hosts alongside Mike called <a href=#>Here’s The Sitch with Mike & Laurens</a>.</p><p>She also recently announced the <a href=#>launch of her own skincare line</a>, Skincare By Laurens, which is something she’d been working on for a while.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Her line is set to launch next week.</p><p>Fans can continue to keep up with Lauren and the rest of the cast as this season of Jersey Shore Family Vacation continues.</p><p>Jersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays at 8/7c on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5qav7Sx2Gaqoaeimnqnrcyio7JlppawosDIqKVmnpGjwG6%2Fy5qkZqSRqr%2BmuoyspquqlaPBqrrOZp2oql2dsrN5wZ6fmq6ZpL9uwMeiqmarlZbAsLqO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-machi-illness-update-what-illness-does-he-have-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Machi Illness Update: What Illness does he have?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffree-star-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffree Star Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
