Laws developed in the state to maintain slavery and crush uprisings included whipping, and dismembering people by cutting off a foot. A <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">study of these laws</a> states that: “A slave giving false evidence would … receive his 39 lashes and then have his ears nailed to the pillory for half an hour, after which they would be cut off.”</p><p class=dcr-1yimvw>An uprising by enslaved people and indentured servants in 1663 in Gloucester County, where Porteus was based, was <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">mercilessly put down</a>, according to an account by the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Colonial Williamsburg Foundation</a>: “Several bloody heads dangled from local chimney tops as a gruesome warning to others.”</p><p class=dcr-1yimvw>Earlier this month, in response to the Guardian’s reporting, Charles <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">signalled for the first time</a> his support for research into the links between the British monarchy and the transatlantic slave trade.</p><p class=dcr-1yimvw>A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said at the time that Charles took “profoundly seriously” the issue of slavery, which he has described as an <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">“appalling atrocity”</a>.

In January, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Fulham Palace Trust</a>, which maintains the historic London bishops’ residence, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">published research on the Porteus plantations</a>.
