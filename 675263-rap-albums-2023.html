Cole performs during the 2023 Dreamville Music festival at Dorothea Dix Park on April 02, 2023 in Raleigh, North Carolina. (Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images)</p><p>Back in 2020, J. Cole took to social media to announce his next three projects. The first of the three, The Off-Season, was released in 2021. Featuring soulful, Southern-centric beats and appearances from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Baby</a> and 21 Savage, the record stood as the rap album of the year. Cole's pen game was at its peak as he reflected on his patient grind to the top of rap. Right before the album's release, he also announced It's a Boy and The Fall Off. The latter of which is speculated to be his final album. With it being two years since the release of The Off-Season, fans are beginning to suspect that It's a Boy will release in 2023.</p><span></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 02: Travis Scott performs onstage during Day 2 of 2018 Governors Ball Music Festival at Randall's Island on June 2, 2018 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Governors Ball)</p><p>It's been five years since Astroworld, a cinematic rollercoaster experience that served as an ode to the Houston community. From the tightknit banger "No Bystanders" to the psychedelic production on "Skeletons," the record's diverse soundscapes set it amongst the best hip-hop records of the 2010s. Scott hasn't been entirely silent since the release of Astroworld. He was the driving force behind the Jackboys compilation. He also released two singles in the form of "ESCAPE PLAN" and "MAFIA."</p><p>However, Utopia has been <a href=# rel>anticipated from fans for years</a>. Back in 2021, rumors were swirling surrounding its release. However, the tragic events at the Astroworld Festival delayed Utopia's release. Back in February, Epic Records' Sylvia Rhone announced, We have a new Travis Scott album, expected to come in June." We're only a few weeks away from June and so far, there haven't been any signs on Scott's front that he cemented a release date for his highly-anticipated album.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-playboi-carti-narcissist>Playboi Carti - Narcissist</h2></span><p>LONDON, ENGLAND - JULY 02: (EDITORIAL USE ONLY) Playboi Carti performs on day 2 of Wireless Festival 2022 at Crystal Palace Park on July 02, 2022 in London, England. (Photo by Burak Cingi/Redferns)</p><p>Whole Lotta Red's build-up went down in hip-hop history. Between cryptic Carti's cryptic tweets and announcements from his associations, his second studio album was a last-minute album of the year contender. Released on Christmas night, the album was met with mixed reactions upon its release. Diverting from the banger cloud rap sound synonymous with Carti, the Atlanta-born aggressor carved out a new lane of punk rap on Whole Lotta Red.</p><p>With Narcissist, the assumption from fans is that Playboi Carti will dive further into the tone of tracks such as "Punk Monk" and "Stop Breathing." However, up until this point, the album's rollout has consisted of <a href=# rel>a motorsports clothing line</a> and a tour. So far, he hasn't released a single that even indicates where he'll be heading on his next album. Although information surrounding Narcissist is limited, he confirmed that music is on the way in an interview with XXL. "I've been rapping about going to rehab," he revealed. "I want to go to rehab because I think I'm bipolar. Everybody should feel free. I want this album to make everybody feel free."</p><span></span><p>INGLEWOOD, CA - AUGUST 27: Nicki Minaj attends the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 27, 2017 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p>Nicki Minaj diverted from the world of music for the past half-decade, especially as she ventured into the business world. However, Minaj confirmed plans to release <a href=# rel>her fifth studio album in 2023</a>. 2018's Queen was met with a generally positive reception although, her loyal and dedicated fanbase didn't seem to hold it to the same standard as her previous efforts. However, Minaj has vowed that her next album will be "the best thing that will come out of 2023 and will raise the bar to new and unreachable heights." Additionally, she revealed plans to hit the road. She added, "NM5 tour will be hailed as genius. That's it and that's all." It looks like Nicki Minaj is coming for the title of the best rap album of 2023.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-ap-rocky-don-t-be-dumb>A$AP Rocky - Don't Be Dumb</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 25: A$AP Rocky performs onstage during the 2021 Governors Ball Music Festival at Citi Field on September 25, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Governors Ball)</p><p>It's been five years since the release of A$AP Rocky's Testing. Fans widely regard the project as a competent albeit limited effort from the Harlem MC. Collaborating in the fashion world, spearheading a whiskey line, and starting a family with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Rihanna</a>, Rocky has certainly stayed busy over the past five years. Rocky was also jailed in Sweden for assault charges, sparking a #freeRocky campaign across the United States. However, rumors of his fourth studio album have been swirling around the Internet over the past calendar year.</p><p><a href=# rel>Titled Don't Be Dumb</a>, Rocky teased his contender for the best rap album of 2023 with the release of the single, "Same Problems?" back in January. Differing from artists such as Playboi Carti, Rocky hasn't been coy about the sonic direction of the project. In an interview with GQ, he revealed that Metro Boomin's production will be featured throughout much of the album. In addition, Rocky has been performing new music during recent performances. He was seen filming a music video for a song off of Don't Be Dumb in Paris in late April.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-schoolboy-q-untitled-album>Schoolboy Q - Untitled Album</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 23: Schoolboy Q Visits Music Choice on April 23, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)</p><p>Schoolboy Q's CrasH Talk was met with a mixed reception. The golfer's laid-back flows and LA-based basslines made the album a signature addition to his discography. However, many fans haven't taken to the record in comparison to projects such as the Blank Face LP. Schoolboy Q announced his new album all the way back in 2020. Since then, we've heard very little Q. The exception is 2022's "Soccer Dad," a straightforward featuring minimal trumpet-based production.</p><p>Thanks to The Alchemist, we know that the two are working on a new album. In reference to Schoolboy Q's feature on The Alchemist's "Clip In a Tray," The Alchemist stated, "Wait till you hear the s**t we got for his album" in response to a post on Instagram. On top of that, Anthony "Top Dawg" Tiffith suggested that Q's <a href=# rel>readying a 2023 release</a>. So far, no word from Q but the updates from Alc and Top Dawg is a promising sign that Q's follow-up to CrasH Talk is on the way.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-coi-leray-untitled-album>Coi Leray - Untitled Album</h2></span><p>INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 05: Coi Leray performs during 2023 Rolling Loud Los Angeles at Hollywood Park Grounds on March 05, 2023 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Timothy Norris/WireImage)</p><p>Coi Leray has already begun her rollout for her sophomore studio album, releasing <a href=# rel>singles "My Body" and "Bops"</a> over the past month. Delivering an electric amount of enthusiasm and confidence, Coi Leray has been an uncompromising figure in the music industry since her 2021 XXL Freestyle. Surmounting the doubters, her debut studio album, Trendsetter, established the Boston-born artist as a hit-making force.</p><p>In an Apple Music 1 chat with Eddie Francis, Leray confirmed her new album will only contain "a couple features." Expanding on this, she stated, "the second album's going to make people go back to Trendsetter and make them actually appreciate it for the music instead of the bulls**t and the negative headlines and Coi Leray always being the topic. This album is all about me." With her sophomore effort, fans will be looking for a more focused effort from "Players" superstar.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saweetie-pretty-b-ch-music>Saweetie - Pretty B**ch Music</h2></span><p>DALLAS, TEXAS - APRIL 01: Saweetie performs live at the NCAA Super Saturday Concert at AT&T Discovery District on April 01, 2023 in Dallas, Texas. (Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images)</p><p>Saweetie's debut full-length album was set to arrive all the way back in June 2021. She's been delaying the release of Pretty B**ch Music ever since. In March, she, once again, confirmed that she was still in the process of creating the project. However, she's delivered a string of music since then to hold fans over. In 2022, she released THE SINGLE LIFE EP. However, it's certainly getting to a point where the delay is harming Saweetie's notoriety rather than creating hype. Anchored by the Full Stop Management record label, generating hype for the album may be more difficult than it would've been a year ago. However, the extensive delay will hopefully result in her best work to date.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">[via]</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIJzgpJmqZqoXZa5o8HMrGRraGJo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./inside-elton-john-david-furnish-playroom-windsor-home.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rare glimpse inside Elton John and David Furnish's eclectic playroom for sons at 4.2m home</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./health-and-fitness.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pros and cons of HIIT: benefits of high intensity interval training</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
