Perhaps no actor loves dead animals more than Seyfried, who has collected a small museum’s worth of taxidermy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I have a miniature zebra [<i>Ted 2 </i>director] Seth MacFarlane bought me, and a baby horse, but that’s the biggest I’ll go to. They’re twice the size of my dog Finn, and they’re called Kevin Sparkle and Antoine Woodberry. On top of that there’s an owl called Beatrix, a chick called Linda, and a deer called Sha’ Dynasty,” Seyfried explained of her obsession on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><i>Conan O’Brien</i> in 2012</a>. “It’s a real menagerie.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every time she adds another member to her pet cemetery, she gives each departed creature a loving name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I have a chick I just got, her name is Linda. Well, she’s not alive. Her name <i>would’ve</i> been Linda,” she continued. The chick was named in tribute to Seyfried’s idol, the late <i>Deep Throat</i> actor Linda Lovelace, whom she played in the 2013 film, <i>Lovelace.</i></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her taxidermy obsession began in the late 2000s after Seyfried paid a visit to Deyrolle, a taxidermy store in Paris. “It's one of the biggest taxidermy stores in the world,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1><i>InStyle</i> in 2013</a>. “I love animals so much. From 20 feet away these look real.” Entranced at the realistic look of these animals, whose carcasses are given new life, she has said she considers them works of art.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>TBS</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the memory of your family pet lives on in your home, its body may be in Amanda Seyfried’s. And she’s not alone in finding beauty in the formerly living. Other celebrity taxidermy enthusiasts include Martha Stewart, who hosts game birds at her Maine property, Jack White, who owns a $12,500 elephant head, and Angelina Jolie, who acquired a flock of deceased birds after her child, Shiloh, brought one home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Shiloh found a dead bird, so she came in and said, 'Can I have a dead pet?'" Jolie told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1><i>Vogue</i></a> in 2010. "And I'm ... 'Uh-uh, I don't think it's healthy, honey. I think they have to put him in a box,' and I had to run out to find, like, a taxidermy bird. I just worked it out for her […] I figured that I couldn't keep the actual dead bird from the yard, so I swayed her toward one that had been cleaned, at least."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seyfried suggested that part of the appeal of taxidermy is that it’s much easier caring for dead animals than it is live ones. You don’t say …</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The real question, however, is does Seyfried find being surrounded by a bunch of lifeless, glassy-eyed creatures a bit creepy? “No!” she told this magazine back in 2013.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Well, certain faces can be creepy. You have to buy what feels right […] My baby deer, Sha' Dynasty, was the most expensive one because I bought her from a French artist in L.A.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Seyfried has admitted that she does have dreams where “the animals come alive and talk with me,” she told Conan. “There is an energy that you walk into when you walk into your house, there are these animals staring at you.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That is the saddest thing I’ve ever heard,” O’Brien interrupted. (O’Brien later surprised the actor with a fun gift: a taxidermied raccoon attached to a jet pack.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ethicists be warned: all of her animals died of natural causes, she’s quick to point out. Though all of Seyfried’s dead pets join her living Australian shepherd, Finn, Seyfried considers her dog when making new acquisitions. (Her miniature horse was intended to be Finn's new best friend “unless he tries to eat it,” she told the <i>UK Press Association</i>.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she has bought a zoo, Seyfried has admitted she is not finished adding to her chosen family. For now, she and husband Thomas Sadoski, are working on building her other family — the couple welcomed their <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>second child</a> earlier this week. We can only imagine what the blending of these two families will look like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8CmmKeckWLApsXFq6CenF2prrm1w56pprFdpK%2B0sdKsoKim</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-crazy-history-of-water-wars.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Crazy History Of Water Wars</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./672831-summer-walker-tokyo-toni-chrisean.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Summer Walker Is Here For Tokyo Toni &amp;amp; Chrisean Rock At Baddies East Auditons</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
