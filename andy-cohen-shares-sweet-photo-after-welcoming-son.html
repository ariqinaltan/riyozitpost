This is my son, Benjamin Allen Cohen,"&nbsp;Cohen wrote to his 3 million followers, captioning a sweet black-and-white snapshot of the new father-son duo. "He is&nbsp;9 lbs 2 ounces !!&nbsp;20 inches !! Born at 6:35 pm, PT," the proud dad continued, before explaining the special meaning behind his little bundle of joy's name. "He is named after my grandfather Ben Allen."&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside heart and rainbow emojis, Cohen concluded his heartfelt post with, "I'm in love. And speechless. And eternally grateful to an incredible surrogate. And I'm a dad. Wow."</p><p>As <a href=#>Nicki Swift</a> previously reported, Cohen, 50, first announced that he was expecting his first child via surrogate during <a href=#>a special segment on his popular show</a> in late December 2018.&nbsp;"I have always tried to be as transparent as possible about my life. I over share and I expect everyone around me to do the same,"&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV producer&nbsp;began, before sharing the exciting news. "And&nbsp;tonight I want you to be the first to know that after many years of careful deliberation, a fair amount of prayers, and the benefit of science, if all goes according to plan, in about six weeks time, I am going to become a father thanks to a wonderful surrogate who is carrying my future."</p><p>Cohen continued, "Family means everything to me and having one of my own is something that I have wanted in my heart for my entire life and though it has taken me longer than most to get there, I cannot wait for what I envision will be the most rewarding chapter yet."</p><p>While co-hosting CNN's live broadcast on New Year's Eve alongside pal <a href=#>Anderson Cooper</a>, Cohen revealed his child's sex.&nbsp;"I got to tell you something, I cannot wait to meet this boy," he told the TV journalist (via <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>). "I think he's going to have a nice Semitic head of hair. I'm so excited. I think about nothing else." Just last week,&nbsp;dozens of Cohen's friends in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Real Housewives</a>&nbsp;sphere threw him&nbsp;<a href=#>a gorgeous baby shower</a>&nbsp;at the The Palm in Beverly Hills, Calif. The event followed&nbsp;A Star Is Born&nbsp;theme.</p><p>Prior to&nbsp;<a href=#>calling it quits with his longtime boyfriend</a>,&nbsp;Harvard grad student Clifton Dassuncao,&nbsp;last year, Cohen had opened up to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>Today</a>&nbsp;show about raising a child one day, noting, "I feel like I can just do it."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/uploads/embed/embed-5c59d5028bafa.jpg border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=gallery-image-credit>Getty Images</span><p>After Cohen's baby news broke, a number of his famous friends took to social media to congratulate him on becoming a father. "Congratulations Andy!"&nbsp;singer-songwriter <a href=#>John Mayer</a> wrote on <a href=#>Instagram</a> alongside a snapshot of baby moccasins. For his part, the new dad wrote in the comments section,&nbsp;"I love you. I can't wait for you to meet him tomorrow" (via <a href=#>ET</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=#>Sex and the City</a> alum Sarah Jessica Parker <a href=#>reposted Cohen's cute pic</a>, writing, "At long last. And February 4 will never be the same. We are already madly in love. Welcome Benjamin Allen Cohen we've got big plans for you." Sharing&nbsp;<a href=#>a photo of a rainbow cake</a>&nbsp;with an "It's a boy" announcement on top, morning show host <a href=#>Kelly Ripa</a>&nbsp;wrote,&nbsp;"It sure is! Welcome Benjamin! We've been waiting for you!!! Mazel Tov @bravoandy."</p><p>And, of course, several of your Real Housewives faves quickly joined in on celebrating Cohen's newest little addition, including&nbsp;<a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>, who <a href=#>wrote</a>, "All the love in the world to&nbsp;@bravoandy&nbsp;& Ben! Congratulations on this amazing journey you're about to embark on, each day your heart will grow in ways you didn't think possible. I'm so happy for you!!!"&nbsp;For her part, Bethenny Frankel <a href=#>tweeted</a>, "Congratulations @Andy on the greatest love of your life Benjamin Allen Cohen!!! Baby you've got #BAC."</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/uploads/embed/embed-5c59df742eefc.jpg border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=gallery-image-credit>Getty Images</span><p>Readers may already be aware that Cohen recently moved his talk show,&nbsp;Watch What Happen Live with Andy Cohen, from New York City to Los Angeles in mid-January for a temporary four-week taping schedule in order to prepare for welcoming his son.&nbsp;"Moving the Clubhouse to L.A. is a win all the way around," he told <a href=#>People</a> magazine at the time. "There will be great guests, great energy and I can make a 9 p.m. dinner reservation after we get off the air!"</p><p>According to a source cited by <a href=#>Page Six</a> on Tuesday, Feb. 5, Bravo will reportedly air pre-recorded episodes of the hit pop culture show through the end of next week. However,&nbsp;fans who are&nbsp;dying to hear Cohen weigh in on the latest in celebrity gossip again apparently won't have to wait too long. After&nbsp;taking a short break from work to enjoy being a dad,&nbsp;the titular host will reportedly return to the small screen the week of Monday, Feb. 18.</p><p>Just like his celebrity pals, we couldn't be happier for Andy Cohen. Congrats again to the television mogul on his exciting <a href=#>baby news</a>!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxkbIB2e8Cnm7Jlk6S1prqMrJ%2BaqpWoerTDxJ6rZqiYpMGwecCfq56qXayyra%2FOpqCnn12ovK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aussie-woman-shares-texts-that-exposed-cheating-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aussie woman shares texts that exposed 'cheating' boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-bynes-net-worth-revealed-ahead-of-former-nickelodeon-star-38-birthday-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Bynes' net worth revealed ahead of former Nickelodeon star's 38th birthday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./1592065-na-fake-love-burna-boy-hangs-wizkid-davidos-portraits-house-fans-react.html>&amp;quot;This Na Fake Love&amp;quot;: Burna Boy Hangs Wizkid and Davido's Portraits in His House, Fans React</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./target-sweater-fleece-sale-2021.html>Amazon Top 15 Trending Fall Fashion Picks Include Uggs and Sweaters</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gma-amy-robach-berlin-marathon-announcement.html>Amy Robach inundated with support after new announcement</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./andy-milonakis-biography-age-height-personal-life-career-heritage.html>Andy Milonakis Biography, Age, Height, Personal Life, Career, History</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-you-the-one-season-9-release-date-cast-and-more-information.html>Are You The One?
