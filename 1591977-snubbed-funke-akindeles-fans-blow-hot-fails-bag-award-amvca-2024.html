Tribe called Judah is a mainstream movie, you watch once have a good laugh move on, Breath of life will be memorable.”<p class=align-left>digital6ix:</p>“The storyline of Breathe of Life was really great, and the movie tackled important societal issues that are unfortunately still prevalent in our country today, such as the oppression of the poor by the rich, the use of thugs to instill fear in citizens, misinterpretation of the law, and jungle justice. The actors also did an excellent job in their roles, and the location of the movie was impressive.

This same person has bagged these awards in the past. There are other talents who deserve to be seen.More importantly, the amount a movie grossed isn’t proportional to the it’s quality. Marvel movies do very well in box office but you don’t see them bagging all the Oscars.
